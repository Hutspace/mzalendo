Out of this number, about 840, representing 57 per cent are Ghanaians.\n The Ministry is unable to know the exact number from the Western Region employed in the oil and gas sector as the information gathering instruments do not make provision for regional consi- derations.\n The Ministry, however, recognises that exploitation of the oil and gas resources located in the Western Region certainly have some environmental risks to the citizens and generated high expectations from the population. The Ministry, in recognition of these and other considerations, has put in place, the following specific interventions in the Western Region to address some of these challenges:\n 1. The Ministry, in collaboration with Tullow Ghana, is establishing an SME Skills Development Centre in Takoradi.\n 2. The Ministry and Tullow have allocated 40 per cent of annual scholarships initiated by Tullow, to train Ghanaians in UK universities in areas of oil and gas to the Western Region. -\n 3. The Petroleum Commission will have an operational office in Takoradi.\n 4. The Government is implementing a western corridor infrastructural development programme that will be funded by the CDB loan.\n\n5.

The only way to do so, is to create winners along the entire value chain, while emphasing resource recycling\n Madam Speaker, the green economy that is being advocated has become an ethical issue globally. It is now common to find that certain people will not consume certain items unless they are sure that they were produced while steps were taken to protect the environment. And I believe that many of us here should be converted into such consumers, so that those who abuse the environment for economic gain, would have a smaller market to deal with into the future.\n Madam Speaker, we have to act quickly and act reasonably and sensibly, so that the future generations can also have an environment to promote their economic and social lives.\n Madam Speaker, to end, I think that we must have a massive change in attitude, change in consumption, change in production, change in processing, change in the use of natural resources before we can get to the promised land.\n I would want to quote Albert Einstein, since he is, the person of the day that my Hon Colleague opposite quoted.

If you come to my own Western Region, recently, when we started the oil and gas exploration and production, there has been a lot of oil spill, there has been a lot of degradation of the sea, such that whales have been dying.\nWe have had a lot of green growth that does not usually come into the sea, such that our fishermen have not been able to catch a lot of fishes in the sea in the Western Region. Clearly, they are losing income and livelihoods are being lost.\nMadam Speaker, we have also spoken about the issue of galamsey, destroying the water bodies. The question is, how do we fix the problem? This is because we cannot continue talking about the solution for the last 40 years without providing answers. I believe that in the area of galamsey, it is time that this country established galamsey parks, make sure they are protected, they are well- serviced and we are sure that they will not affect the environment badly.\nOn the issue of rubber, I believe that it is time that this country had a policy of no littering of waste and rubber on our streets. I am told that in Singapore, you cannot even drop a chewing gum.

Madam Speaker, I would go straight to the point.\n The celebration of the World Environment Day started since 1972. So in 2012, we are talking about 40 years. Instead of the environment improving, it is rather degrading. Therefore, it shows that all the celebrations that we have had over the years have come to nothing. I believe that the most important thing we need to ask ourselves is, what should we do and I believe that the change has to be now?\n Now, if you take the theme for the celebration of this year's World Environment Day, it is \"Green Economy,\n\nDoes It include You?\" And I think these are the solutions that we need to provide to ensure that we are actually making an effort in solving the problems of the environment.\n\nNow, if we take the environment, if it gets degraded, a lot of people suffer. If you come to my own Western Region, recently, when we started the oil and gas exploration and production, there has been a lot of oil spill, there has been a lot of degradation of the sea, such that whales have been dying.\n\nWe have had a lot of green growth that does not usually come into the sea, such that our fishermen have not been able to catch a lot of fishes in the sea in the Western Region. Clearly, they are losing income and livelihoods are being lost.\n\nMadam Speaker, we have also spoken about the issue of galamsey, destroying the water bodies. The question is, how do we fix the problem? This is because we cannot continue talking about the solution for the last 40 years without providing answers. I believe that in the area of galamsey, it is time that this country established galamsey parks, make sure they are protected, they are well- serviced and we are sure that they will not affect the environment badly.\n\nOn the issue of rubber, I believe that it is time that this country had a policy of no littering of waste and rubber on our streets. I am told that in Singapore, you cannot even drop a chewing gum. So, how come that we allow ourselves, that in this country, everywhere you go, the whole place is littered with rubber, including even Parliament.

Early on, I listened to the Hon Prof. Ameyaw-Akumfi, with respect to trying to equate animals to humans. I would say that we are even mixing issues relating to animals with that of humans.\n The Hon Chairman of the Committee rises up to say that the Committee is proposing a new clause, and when I looked at the clause, it is not different from what we had early on done. What the new clause is trying to say, is that the provisions of Part 1 to 5 on communicable diseases, vaccination, quarantine and vector control apply to animals. So where then is the difference, when you take vaccination?\n I think that we are dealing with public health, which relates to human beings. Why then do we lump in the health of animals, mixed them together to come out with a law, a law that would cover the health of animals and the health of -' where we have defined \"animals\" to include \"vermin\". \"Vermin\" includes cockroaches, worms, all manner of things, and we are looking at public health. Is he telling me that we are looking at public health in relation to cockroaches? I am at a loss; I am completely at a loss.\n Mr Speaker, if we are removing animals from this particular Bill, let us say so, because there is an existing law on diseases and health control relating to animals. That law is there. But when we are talking about public health, I believe that it is about human health, but not to mix up animals and humans when animals have been defined to include fleas, lice, mice, cockroaches and so on and so forth.

There is an existing law, which is Act 83 -- Diseases of Animals Act of 1961. The difficulty is managing it. So What this Bill seeks to do is to create a common platform for managing them.
