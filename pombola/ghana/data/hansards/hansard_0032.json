However, it is also important to emphasise that for medical doctors to go on strike, it means that they consider it to be the last resort, knowing the consequences of the strike action they take.\n Mr Speaker, reading the Statement of _ the Hon Member, a point is made that it seems those who engage in the negotiations do not seem to have the authority to take a final decision. That is also symptomatic of the way things are organised in this country. I personally have had the benefit of being engaged in discussions with groups that were on strike.\n It is important that on these matters the State recognises that there is the need for finality so that those who go to negotiate feel confident that they have the full mandate to take a decision.\n It has happened to me before. Yes, one does not have the final decision and one may agree tentatively, people are happy, then one goes back and they say \"No, we cannot handle this\". So it is important that all those Who are in a position to give clearance should be at the table. I agree we have processes but it gets to a stage we do not need to go through the entire process. All those who are involved can be there so that finality can be brought to these negotiations.\n It is also important, particularly, having regard to what has been going on all over the world, to state that probably, as the political leadership, there is the need for us to have some introspection. Just a couple of Weeks ago, when the UN Secretary-General, His Excellency Ban Ki- moon had occasion to address the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU) General Assembly, he made the comment that with\n\nthe tumult going round the world probably it was symptomatic of a deficit of trust of the people in political leadership - trust deficit.

Indeed, we are making sure that the medical suppliers are quickly delivered to 37 Military Hospital and the Police Hospital in Accra and in the other regions. Government is aware that emergencies are required to be treated there.\n So we are not going to employ any difficulties in terms of medical supplies. The President himself was on the site to ensure that these things are done. We are going to make sure to save as many lives as we can. But to this House once more, thank you for showing the concern.",

The doctors against the nurses, nurses-against pharmacists and pharmacists against other health workers. Mr Speaker, that would not augur well for our health delivery service.

I think the action of the Health Committee is very, very commendable.\n Mr Speaker, from their engagement with the GMA, we now know, this House knows that there are three main issues that the medical officers have raised. One is the grade structure of the medical officers, the market premium of medical doctors and additional duty hours undertaken by them.\n Mr Speaker, I think as a nation, we should understand that the market premium on medical officers has really gone very, very high. In the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada, many brilliant minds no longer want to pursue courses in medicine.\n This is because, now Information Communication Technology (ICT) is a greener area, most science students are gravitating towards pursuing courses in ICT. They have shorter duration and they earn much higher than medical officers who spend five or six years in school.\n Mr Speaker, it is why in the United Kingdom, in the United States of America and in Canada today, we have an influx of medical officers from India to the health facilities of these countries. As we do know, the start-off pay in the UK for general practitioners (GPs) who are newly- recruited is in the region of 5,500 pounds which translates to close to 150 million old Ghana cedis or GH\u00a2l5,000.

            "speech": "the metropolis. Now, and today, we have the Accra floods and we have all heard the harrowing tales of death, disasters and of grief that have been expressed by the people in this capital city of ours.\n Why do we have such a monumental flooding after four or five hours of rain each time this happens\u2018? It is because our drains and gutters are choked with filth that are man-made; these are not natural filths or blockages, these are filth that we collect from our homes and some of us dump these filth and\u2018 garbage into our drains and gutters.\n People have also built in waterways and there is also inadequate drainage because we have uncovered gutters that people find easy to dump these garbage in. I think we can have our solutions in building more drains, making sure that our primary and storm drains are not used as garbage sites and dumps. We should also put funds aside in our Budget for these happenings that we call force majeure. There are certain disasters that we cannot predict.\n One area that I will call on all of us and as a government, to be proactive in, is the area of providing funds to Members of Parliament and District Assemblies to undertake flood control in our areas as we did some time ago by giving each Member of Parliament, twenty-five million old cedis to undertake flood control in the constituencies. So that in one breath, we had the whole of Ghana being covered by our Members of Parliament in their contributory aspect of making sure that our constituencies are cleared of filth.\n Mr Speaker, we should also equip our NADMO officials with enough logistics to be able to undertake some of these\n\nlogistical distributions. Mr Speaker, we should also commend, in this process, our security forces who are teaming up with the NADMO officials to provide solace and logistics to our grief stricken brothers and sisters. Mr Speaker, I believe that one area that we fail to also pay attention to is the information given by the Meteorological Services. They predict how the weather is going to be but I wonder how many of us take that into consideration when we are even going out of our homes.\n\nWe should sensitise the citizenry and make sure that we even translate it into our various languages for them to understand what all this means. We should also make sure that all our electrical installations are duly protected with the necessary scientific gadgets so that we do not have the disasters of fire outbreaks and electrocution when these floods occur.\n\nWe should also make sure that in the whole process, our water bodies are protected because some of these debris that get into our Water bodies get them contaminated which also cause a lot of diseases and we hope that these floods will not cause any outbreak of cholera and any water home diseases.\n\nMr Speaker, I believe I will wind up by wishing that this will not happen again and if it does, we will be combat ready to make sure we provide the necessary logistics to our compatriots.\n\nThank you Speaker.",

            "speech": "floods that we have been having in this country. Mr Speaker, I will like to draw the attention of all the stakeholders in this direction.\n Often, we say that people are building in water courses, therefore, we take corrective measures by pulling down houses that are being built on water courses. But Mr Speaker, the question is this, if somebody has blocked a water course by putting up a house in that place and we go and pull it down without clearing the debris and all those things from the water course what do we expect as a country? I think the time has come that we have to move beyond demolition and go into clearing those areas of water courses after the demolition.\n Without doing that, we will end up putting ourselves into more danger than if we had even allowed that building to be there. Mr Speaker, beside that, you go round certain places in Accra and you see some unauthorised structures that have just been destroyed- So instead of demolishing and removing the unauthorised structures - we are not removing unauthorised structures, we are demolishing and destroying them. You take the road from Achimota to Legon and you see kiosks and all unauthorised structures that have just been destroyed and they are allowed to be there; what do We expect?\n Mr Speaker, the second point I will want to add is this. When road contractors are constructing roads, I think the era has come that they may provide a place for water to flow away whenever it is raining. This current flood issue that we are talking of, information reaching me indicate that the most hit places are the Graphic Road and the Achimota-Ofankor Road where construction is taking place and I am told\n\nthat the contractors have blocked certain places and therefore it was difficult for water to flow away. I was also told that even on the Graphic Road, officers cannot cross the water and enter their offices in front of Toyota Ghana and other places.\n\nSo I think we have to move beyond demolition, we have to move beyond destruction and therefore clear unauthorised structures in certain places.\n\nWith this, I know we may not be caught up by flood tomorrow only to be lamenting on it.\n\nThank you very much, Mr Speaker and I thank the maker of the Statement for drawing our attention to it.",

Is it not because we are not enforcing any of the regulations that relate to environment in the country? How come we have rules and regulations on land use, buildings and yet people build on waterways, then We come to complain that because of those buildings, floods are occurring.\n Who are responsible? Unless we are willing and ready to enforce all the rules and regulations relating to land use in the country, we may continue to experience floods due to indiscipline in construction and I think that as a country, we should start taking the laws we make seriously. Sometimes, I wonder why we spend so much time here in this House, debating, talking, spending man hours on insertion and deletion and after that, that is the end, the laws we make are not enforced.",

It is technology, it is commitment, it is money but they did it.\n So my view is that, the problems of Accra, we all know them, it is time we focused, found the appropriate technology, paid the cost it requires to fix them and fix it.\n Mr Speaker, I think that we have had Statements and debates up and down like this for far too long. If we found the solution now, it becomes an issue - \"Oh this Minister did that\", or it is too expensive\"; \"it is prolific expenditure\" - - does it solve the problem? If it does it does, not matter how much it cost, it was worth it.\n I wish to urge this House to make a strong case to the Executive to find the appropriate technology, design the appropriate constructional designs, pay the cost financially and solve the problem.\n Mr Speaker, this is my little contribution.",
