However, Mr. Speaker, when Act 272 of 2008 was passed, it was not envisaged that today the Registrar-General and other agencies may be able to do electronic registration of companies.\n Mr. Speaker, I am told by my Colleague the Hon Minister for Trade and Industry that there is a recent World Bank report which says that, it takes a maximum of three days to register a company in Ghana if not more-For instance, authentication of documents and even before you get to certificate to commence business. We have through some World Bank support, automated the Registrar-General\u2019s Department and other revenue agencies such as the Ghana Revenue Authority.\n By this amendment, Act 772 precluded the registration of companies online. We are therefore seeking this amendment so that from now, the Registrar-General\u2019s Department can do electronic registration of companies and business registration names. That will improve the efficiency in the service delivery and will facilitate e- commerce in Ghana and propel the Registrar-General\u2019s Department into a digital world. It is now fully computerized in its operations and we think that an integration electronically will provide for a faster, more user friendly -\n\nIndeed, it will also make it possible that any person wanting to conduct a search on a company can do so online.

The Standing Orders of the House.\n 1.2 Object of the Bill\n The object of the Bill is to amend the Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 (Act 772) to ensure that the registration of companies, partnerships and sole proprietorships can be done by electronic means to conform to the New Companies Bill and to make the automation of the Registrar-General\u2019s Department effective.\n 1.3 Background\n The Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 (Act 772) was passed in 2008 and provides for electronic communications and related transactions in the public interest. It ensures the prevention and removal of barriers that affect electronic communications and transactions in Ghana. The Act promotes legal certainty and confidence in the electronic communications and related transactions in Ghana.\n The Act applies to electronic transactions and records of every type. It helps to facilitate the use of electronic medium by recognizing the need to provide a framework for the preparation,\n\nprocessing, storage, transmission and receipt of electronic data in a secured, efficient and trustworthy manner.\n\nEven though the Act provided for and facilitated the use of electronic communications and related transactions, it excluded, under Section 4, certain aspects of documentation or records that at the time were directly regulated under specific regulations.\n\nSection 4 (g) and (h) of the Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 (Act 772) which excludes aspects of documents and records from the scope of electronic transactions and records recognized by the Act states as follows:\n\nThis Act does not apply, among others, to:\n\ng) documents required for the registration of a company, partnership or sole proprietorships;\n\nh) the swearing of affidavits or statutory declarations before a Commissioner of Oaths or Notary Public.\n\nSection 4 (g) and (h) above, that deals with documents required for the registration of companies under the Companies Act, 1963 and other laws and the swearing of affidavits and statutory declarations before a Commissioner of Oaths or Notary Public through manual processes, conflicts with the new Companies Bill that seeks to promote the use of ICT and electronic records or documents in the registration of companies to expedite business registrations in the country.\n\nThe Bill is therefore to guarantee that the issues connected with these specific areas of registration of companies by electronic means are unambiguously regulated through the amendment of Act\n\n772",

The Committee expresses its appreciation to the Minister and his team of experts for their invaluable assistance.\n 2. Observation\n The Committee made the following observations during the consideration of the Bill.\n 2.1 Business orientation\n The Committee observed that the inclusion of Section 4 (g) and (h) of Act 772 was a restraint to the establishment and development of business concerns.\n In the era where technological advancement has simplified procedures, processes, documentation and activities involved in establishing and developing business entities with particular reference to business registration, the exclusion of the swearing of statutory declarations before a Commissioner of Oaths or a Notary Public, and documents required for registration of business concerns from the coverage of the Electronic Transactions Act, 2008 (Act 772) was not only inconsistent with emerging global trends but also had the tendency to slow down business registration processes and procedures.\n Besides, the Committee observed that this could result in discouraging investment in general as it would make Ghana appear to be an unattractive destination for investment.\n\n2.2 Technology\n\nThe Committee observed that the Continued application of the said Section 4 (g) and (h) was disincentive to technological development as it precludes the application of technology to certain statutory declarations and business registration.\n\nTechnological revolution has become a driving force behind the development agenda of the world at large.\n\nRestrictions such as those imposed by the continued application of Section 4(g) and (h) were therefore found.

There was an attempt earlier to decentralize this. At first, when you want to incorporate a company, everybody must physically come to Accra.\n The first step, Mr. Speaker, was an attempt to take the registration of companies to other regions which was welcomed. But this is another step forward, an important step forward where indeed, you can register a company, you can do transactions with companies anywhere in your office, anywhere electronically.\n The banking sector has started it.

Last but not least, the sector Ministry should also work on public education.\n Most of the times, we do not use these laudable amendments, we create the opportunities and it stays right here at the Hansard Department or within Parliament. So we will urge the Hon Minister to support public education, dissemination of information that this opportunity is available so that you can sit in your home and register a company to encourage FDI and to also build our local economies, especially the young information technology prone people in our country.\n Mr. Speaker, with these few words I want to urge the women entrepreneurs to lead this change in using the technology. This is because we are already embracing it but we should let Ghana know that doing business online could be safe, could be economically viable and we will lead this in the sub-region.",

There is a new Bill which is coming and Mr. Speaker, it is important that we prepare and anticipate the future, than just holding ourselves to today.\n What we are seeking to do is that, with this amendment, the Registrar- General\u2019s Department can still undertake both manual and electronic registration of companies; What it does is that data security and its integrity will be enhanced, lower compliance cost and operating cost, we can conduct online searches concurrently and shorten the processing time - [Interruption] _",
