One of the major limiting factors to these evaluations was the obsolete mining infrastructure inherited. In addition, drastic changes in both the national and worldwide economic climate (such as the cost of oil and electricity) posed significant pressures on the financial viability of the project.\n However, given the significant increases in gold price over the past two years, a re-examination of the strategy was carried out that aimed at re-starting mining operations on a smaller production scale than previously targeted. It is envisioned that this would facilitate a phased approach to the refurbishment of the infrastructure and development of the mining areas.\n In addition to the over US$55 million invested by Golden Star Resource since 2002, an equally significant investment is required to develop the mine.\n Viability of the Prestea Underground Mine\n The continuing \"robust gold prices (US$ 1,200 per ounce) in recent times and the planned optimization of mining costs will support ongoing development of the underground operations.

I would explain that later.\n\nWe also have 27 Legislative Instruments to be laid; 28 Papers to be laid; two committee reports (from ECOWAS and Pan-African Parliaments); 66 other referrals to committees.\n\nThese also include Questions to be asked of Hon Ministers. So, from this itinerary, we have a long. list of items to do. So, I had the opportunity of meeting the Hon Ministers yesterday and we have decided that when the Business committee meets in the future, we have to prioritize the work that we have between now and December ending.\n\nSuffice it to add, Mr Speaker, that on or by the middle of November, we have to be taking the Budget from the Hon Minister for Finance and Economic Planning for and on behalf of the President. So, I recall that if the Budget starts sometime in the middle of November, it will be difficult to take legislation or other activity side by side with the Budget because the Budget is of prime importance for us to pass before we rise.\n\nSo, I have to take this opportunity to implore Hon Members, particularly Hon Chairpersons and Ranking Members of Committees to be able to deliver their responsibilities timeously in the Chamber. I also take the opportunity to urge Hon Members to be punctual in our work in the Chamber; not just to be punctual but to be available in the Chamber for us to",

It is a very delicate affair. I think that our responsibility is not just making good laws to govern this country but we are also interested in the welfare of our constituents.\n Mr Speaker, the consequences of this strike action on our constituents is trite knowledge and it will be notorious for somebody to echo the trauma and the desperation going on in our country today.

The imposition of the Constitution requiring us to consider and approve of the Budget before the financial year comes to an end really constricts both space and time needed to deal scrutinizingly with the Budget that comes before us. That is Why if Budgets delay in coming, then we are left with, sometimes, about just four weeks to consider and approve of the Budget. That is not good enough. Parliament requires, at least, eight weeks to deal with the Budget.\n Increasingly, it is becoming difficult for us to have space and time to deal most diligently with Budgets that are presented to us in this House. So, let us urge the Government and also our Colleague the Hon Majority Leader, who is the Leader of Government Business, to dialogue with the Hon Minister so that this time round, we will have the Budget in the early weeks of November. If it is possible to have it, maybe in the first week of November, we will have more time dealing with it.\n Let us not forget, we have fashioned for ourselves a programme which allows us, after the presentation of the Budget, to engage experts to have a second look at it and then have a workshop with the various committee chairmen and Ranking Members to open our eyes to certain critical areas which may otherwise elude us. So it is important that we have this broad fold.\n Mr Speaker, let me also remind us that there is one critical matter that is outstanding which we have not found sufficient time to deal with.
