Mrs Akosua Frema Osei-Opare: Mr
Speaker, I have a big problem with the
establishment of this whole unit in the
way it has been couched. If we are looking

[961] 
[MRS OSEI-OPARE]
at a Presidential (Transition) Bill, we are
looking at transfer of power, State and
whatever to the next Government.

12.00 noon

Alhaji Haruna Iddrisu: Mr Speaker, a sentence. 
Theirs is just to oversee an
asset inventory and nothing more. In any
case, even if they are to engage -
[Interruption]

Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Mr Speaker,
I believe the Committee did not take
cognizance of the memorandum to this Bill
in proposing the amendment that is, delete
"procure".

So, I believe the Committee -
[lnterruption] -- may not have
considered the memorandum in detail
before proposing this amendment. So
really, "to procure" is relevant and should
be part of this amendment.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, this is a very critical stage of
this Consideration Stage and I believe we
should -

Some Hon Members -- rose-

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!

Hon Members, please, take your seats.
Hon Members at the back, please, take
your seats, so that we can seriously
participate in this.

Mr Kwame Osei-Prempeh: Mr
Speaker, after careful reading of the
memorandum, I believe there is no need
for that amendment. Mr Speaker, a sentence.

12.10 pm.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I will
call the Chairman of the Committee -

Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker--

Mr Second Deputy Speaker;
Chairman not yet.

Hon Boafo.

Mr Wifliam Ofori Boafo: Mr Speaker,
This is my statement - [Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Hon Members, I will suggest we take
our seats and consider this matter very,
very seriously.

Mr Boafo: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
More statements and more statements -
[Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, Order!

Mr Boafo: Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Boafo, some clafications?
Mr Boafo: Precisely so, Mr Speaker. Some
more statements. And some more statements:
"The officials of the Unit are to be
of State".
Some statement ending with a colon:
"some quote"
Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
what the Hon Member for Akropong is
indicating to us is some more statements.
Some statements alluding to clause 8 (1). _
Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyemang: Mr
Speaker, some statements.
Mr Speaker, a sentence. So I do not believe
that the assets of the Government for that
matter of the State can all be vested in a
so-called "Presidential Estates Unit".

12.20 p.m. 
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: With
these apparent more questions than
answers, I direct that we stand down
clause 8. Further deliberations would be
done outside the House and we would
make progress. _
Clauses 9 - Inventory of Assets.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, there are no listed amendment
for clauses 9 and 10.
Mr Joseph B Aidoo -rose--
Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyemang-
rose-- -


12.40 p.m.

Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyemang: Mr
Speaker,I would want to support him by
saying that we have met at midnight
before. "On the midnight of the 6"‘
Parliament is dissolved", and it is only
then that you can have the processes that
lead to the next set.
- [Interruption]
No, he is talking about before 7th. So
maybe, 5th , they would meet and then elect
a Speaker that would not be sworn-in and
only wait for the dissolution of Parliament
and they would only come for swearing-
in and not election on the 7th day.
[lnterruptions.] We should remember
that immediately after elections -
[lnterruptions.] . .
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!


Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Papa-
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: So I do not
have a proposal. All I am saying is that
the arguments that we are advancing.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker:Very well.
Thank you very much, Hon Papa Owusu-
Ankomah.
Alhaji Abukari Sumani: Mr Speaker,
we would be grateful if the former
Attorney-General and Minister for Justice
can help us with a definition of who is a
Member of Parliament?
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Yes, Hon
Chairman of the Committee - in fact, you
have made a statement --
Alhaji Abukari: It is not a statement;
it is very important.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: It is a
question loaded with a statement.
Alhaji Sumani: We ought to clear our
minds when the Constitution talks about
a Member of Parliament; that will tell us
what the Constitution means by a
"Member of Parliament".
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Mr Speaker,
if you are asking me about the Members
of the Fifth Parliament of the Republic of
Ghana, I will say that they are the Members
who Will be elected after the general
election of 2012.
Mr Bandua -rose-
Mr Felix Twumasi-Appiah: Mr
Speaker, I think the difficulty here has to
do with 48 hours before the 7th January
swearing-in of the Speaker.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Chairman
of the Committee, you would come in later.
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: As Hon Papa
said, if the difficulty is that we want to
improve on the earlier arrangement.

Thank you very much.
Dr A. A. Osei - rose -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: That
would be very tidy.
Hon Dr Akoto Osei, you would wait a
while.
Hon Member: I want us to spread
the contribution as much as possible.
Mr Simon Osei-Mensah:Mr Speaker,
considering the importance of this
particular Bill and the amendments we
want to make, I wish we could suspend
debate now and then consider other serious
Business of the House.
1.00 p.m.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: This is a
House of debate and debate will continue.
Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, in fact, this is the only way
some of these important matters may be
addressed, is the way Hon Members are
doing now.
Hon Yieleh Chireh, you will continue.
Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, a sentence."
[Interruption] Wait, I am coming to
the point. The old Parliament --
[Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!


Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, a sentence. Article 95 (4) says:
"A quote quote quote quote
quote quote quote quote sentences
sentences quote ..." -

So if we meet as Hon Members of
Parliament without even taking an oath
as Such, we can elect a Speaker.
1.10p.m.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, that is not part of the
argument anyway.
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: Mr Speaker, a sentence.

I think that was in 19 - [Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order! 

Mr Kwabena O. Darko-Mensah:
Mr Speaker, a sentence. I have no objection.
Mr Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr
Speaker, a sentence. 
Mr Speaker, a sentence. 
Mr Speaker, another sentence. 
Mr Speaker, even more sentences. 
Having said that, Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: I would want
to second the Motion moved by the
Majority Leader.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
Motion for adjournment has been moved
and seconded. ,
Question put and Motion agreed to.
