Parliamentary business is considerable in volume and the time available for thorough examination of matters before the House is limited. Devices such as Question Time with Ministers and Statements by Members, though useful, are not adequate for purposes of exercising effective oversight of the Executive. Committees are therefore constituted by the House or nominated by the Speaker to ensure detailed scrutiny of legislative proposals presented to Parliament.

The composition, terms, powers, functions, and procedures for conducting business in Committees are regulated by provisions of the Standing Orders made pursuant to Article 103 of the Constitution as well as practice and usage of the House. 

## Types of Committees

Broadly, Select Committees of Parliament are of three kinds:

-  Standing
-  Select - Departmentaly Related Committees
-  Ad Hoc Committees


Whereas all committees are Select Committees, not all Select Committees are Standing Committees.

### Standing Committees
These are appointed at the First Meeting of Parliament after the election of the Speaker and the Deputy Speakers to deal with subjects of continuing concern to the House. Every Member of Parliament must belong to at least one Standing Committee.

### Select Committees
These are subject matter related committees charged with the responsibility of scrutinizing expenditures, management and policies of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).

The following Select Committees have been established:

Food, Agriculture and Cocoa Affairs; Lands and Forestry; Health; Constitutional, Legal and Parliamentary; Works and Housing; Local Government and Rural Development; Foreign Affairs; Employment, Social Welfare and State; Communications; Defence and the Interior; Trade, Industry and Tourism; Environment, Science and Technology; Education Youth, Sports and Culture; Mines and Energy; and Roads and Transport.

### Special/Ad Hoc Committees 
These are appointed by the House to investigate any matter of public importance or any bill that does not come under the jurisdiction of any other Select Committee. They cease to exist upon completion of the task assigned them.

### Committee of the Whole
A Committee of the Whole is a Committee of the entire Membership of Parliament, which may be presided over by the Speaker or one of his Deputy Speakers.
