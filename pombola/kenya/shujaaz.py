devolution: “Hon. Speaker, thank you. It is true that we have a big problem
of health in the country now, which has been made worse by the
process of devolution. What I have said here many times is that
we failed to devolve the way we planned in the Constitution. The
TA and the appropriate law have never been applied. One day the
governors, the Council of Governors and the President decided to
devolve healthcare in a day. It is not possible. The problem we
are seeing in healthcare is also in other places, only that in
health area players are noisy.”
