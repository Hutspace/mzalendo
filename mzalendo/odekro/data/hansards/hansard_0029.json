Aidoo: Mr Speaker, the Hon Minister in his conclusion has indicated that article 20 (6) of the 1992 Constitution cannot therefore apply to acquisitions done before the Constitution came into effect. In his own Answer, he has also indicated that a committee has been set up and it is undertaking inventory of acquisitions and that portions that are not to be retained by Government would be released to the landowners. On what basis then is the Ministry going to release such lands to their owners? What is the principle behind the release of such lands?",
