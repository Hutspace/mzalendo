These figures highlight the devastating human cost of tobacco inhalation, which in turn burden ou.r troubled healthcare system. Why should the innocent suffer because of Someone\u2019s insatiable appetite?\n Madam Speaker, tobacco use and poverty are inextricably linked. Many studies have shown that in the poorest households in some low and middle- income countries,more than 10 per cent of total household expenditure is on tobacco.\n This means that these families have less money to spend on such basic items as food, education and healthcare. In addition to its direct health effects, tobacco use leads to increased healthcare costs. It contributes to higher malnutrition and illiteracy rates, since money that could have been. used for food and education, is spent on tobacco.\n The role of tobacco use in exacerbating poverty and hindering economic development needs to be fully recognized.\n Madam Speaker, in Ghana, the law on tobacco use appears to be too relaxed. Little is said about public smoking. It is very common to see people smoking on the streets without thinking about the health implications of by-standers, especially, children.\n Again, Madam Speaker, my basic economic theory tells me that demand is always high when goods are cheap.

Any time of the day, you call on a medical officer and he is prepared to sacrifice his rest, he is prepared to sacrifice his security, just to come and attend to you to save life. That is the nature of work that doctors do and by so doing, they are exposed to a lot of risks.\n Can you imagine, Madam Speaker, if a patient went to trick a doctor that he was sick and needed attention, what security precaution would that doctor take? For him, the most important thing is how to come and save life. If, in an attempt to render this kind of invaluable service, somebody takes advantage to murder him, what do we say? So, the work of doctors is such that at any one time, they are exposed to risks and that is the area we need to look at.\n On the issue of the police getting involved in this investigation, we know that the Ghana Police Service is up to the task that they have been given.

They were jailed either by influencing or by aiding and abetting corrupt organisations. I would want to agree with Hon Dr Richard Anane that where prostitution per se, and indeed, it is even difficult - In Ghana here as we are, who will you determine to be a prostitute and how are you even going to charge such a person? So if we are going to go the American way by saying that like the way they passed the RICO -- It is all encompassing; it takes care of -- When Al Capone and company were jailed, there were women who were also j ailed and everybody knows that they were prostitutes but they could not have charged them as prostitutes. They were also charged under the same law - RICO. So I think that we should adopt the word \"prostitution\". My Hon Good Friend here was telling me that prostitution has to do with minors. But I am saying that there are already laws that take care of human trafficking. If you take a minor to be given to somebody somewhere, whether the person is a female or a male, there are already laws that deal with human trafficking. So I think that the word \"prostitution\" per se -- If we go by the Hon Member\u2019s rendition and put something there that makes it a more grievous offence instead of just a simple demeanour or felony that we are going to give l0 years or five years or 15 years, I think it will do us a lot of good.",

It has continued to play this role in terms of its contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employnient generation, and as a major source of foreign. exchange earnings. The sector has also made substantial contribution to revenue generation through the payment of export duty, inter alia. Cocoa production/purchases for the 20l l/20 l2 cocoa season in respect of which this stamp duty waiver is sought is expected to reach 850,000 tonnes at a projected Free On Board (FOB) price of US$3 ,3 00.00 per tonne. The Committee was informed that since 1994, COCOBOD\u2019S performance on the International Money Market has been excellent in terms of repayment. Apart from the 2004/2005 crop season where COCOBOD did not access the full amount borrowed, all facilities arranged have been fully utilized and repayment requirements met at due dates.

Respectfully submitted. _ Papa Owusu-Ankomah (NPP - Sek0ndi): Mr Speaker, I beg to second the Motion and to explain that the Receivables-backed Trade Finance Facility Agreement, even though it is a loan, is not guaranteed by the Government of Ghana. It is backed by cocoa sales that Cocoa Board will make. So in that sense, there is no burden on the Consolidated Fund. However, over the years, such Agreements have never been brought to Parliament. It was last year or over the past three years, the matter has been raised that instead of just coming to seek for a Waiver of the stamp duty on the Agreement, the Agreement itself should be brought to Parliament for approval under article 181 (4) of the Constitution. This position is strengthened by section 24 subsection 8 of the Ghana COCOB OD Act, 1984, which provides that those derived whether from outside or Within the Republic as well as the Agreements providing for joint ventures involving the Board shall be subject to clause 4 Of3.I'lI1C16 21 of the Constitution. --[ Interruption. ]",

What happens if we achieve the 900,00 metric tonnes. Mr Speakenwhat happens if we achieve that level? By the calculation, the price is gone up from US$15 billion to US$2 billion. Even though production is coming down, the world market price has shot up. So, the computation relates to 850,000 metric tonnes. What if, according to the Hon Minister for Finance and Economic Planning himself, we hit the target of 900,000 metric tonnes? Ithought, maybe, we were going to be told if it happens that way, maybe, remedies have been put in place to salvage that situation. We have no answer to that possibility. Perhaps, the Deputy Minister may relate to it in his winding up. Mr Speaker, these are some of the critical issues that I thought I felt that we should draw attention to.

This is because we felt that Cocoa Marketing Company was doing so well on the international market and that there was a need to protect that enterprise. Now, I know that there is still pressure for the liberalisation of the external marketing of cocoa. Therefore, it is important for us as a country, to satisfy ourselves that the decisions we are making towards COCOBOD, still holding the monopoly of the external market, are still a more viable option than liberalising it. That is why, all the loans that they take, we must really now begin to let them operate as a proper business, so that We satisfy ourselves that, perhaps, we can earn more if we allow them to be one of the buyers or we would not eam so much. But as a business, I think the time has come for us to scrutinise COCOB OD\u2019s operations.
