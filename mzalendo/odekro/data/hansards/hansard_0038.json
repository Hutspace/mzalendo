And my experience in government is that, when we even have reshuffles, the Hon Ministers who do not need to be vetted, do not immediately take over. There is usually a time lapse. But it is dealt with administratively. It is not known by the House but that also creates problems for us.\n So, I think in all these things - it may help in terms of parliamentary business and the conduct of government business for the Hon Majority Leader to be able to advise the House when the Hon Ministers are even supposed to assume duty, even though it has not been done in the past. It is really not the best. Of course, we may take cognisance of public announce- ments.\n Now, we know that Hon E. T. Mensah is the Hon Minister for Water Resources, Works and Housing. Can we recognise him? Hon Alban Bagbin is the Hon Minister for Health. Probably, in the letters advising them, it may not be immediate but this House does not know. So, do we entertain Hon Bagbin as the Hon Minister for Water Resources, Works and Housing? So, I am saying that we are dealing with governance; as a nation, we progress.\n So, the Leadership, together with Madam Speaker, may discuss these things and find a way which will enable us move ahead democratically.

So 19 is a ceiling, but the minimum is lO. So if there are 18 Cabinet Ministers or 17 Cabinet Ministers, so much the better for us in terms of the financial commitment that we have to go through.\n So Madam Speaker, we are talking the same language; we have the same concerns. I only do not want it to be seen as if the practice has been that, if there is a reshuffle and one Minister is moving from one Ministry to the other, hitherto, the information came to us officially and this time it is not coming and therefore, that is a worry. No! We all agreed that since 1993, this has been the practice. But we are improving every year, every time and I am in line with the concept of improvement of governance.\n So I will take this matter up and urge that the full complement of the list should come and when they take effect, Parliament should get to know, so that business can be done here smoothly.",

The capacity of the existing water supply system (2,500m3/day) which depends on raw water abstract from River Kyeremfa, a tributary of River Afram is inadequate to meet the increasing demand leading to serious Water supply shortages during the dry season.\n The Mampong water supply system was rehabilitated in 1998. The rehabilitation and expansion of the system is therefore aimed at meeting the demand for potable water in the municipality up to the year 2020 for a projected population of approximately 90,000 people.\n The scope of works, supply for services and the rehabilitation project include:",

Inasmuch as Parliament is the only body that can Waive these taxes, I believe that in certain instances, the Hon Minister will do well to advise us because there is what we call double taxation rules that we have.\n With several countries in the world, we have double taxation. So if they pay the taxes here, they are not supposed to pay it in the United Kingdom (UK) or in Germany. I myself had the privilege of signing some of these - at least, initialling them. Therefore, if they say that the taxes on the expatriate staff coming here are not being paid, what we must make sure is Whether they are paying it in their country of origin. This is because the double taxation, Madam Speaker, really means that you pay in Ghana and then you do not pay in your country of origin.\n So they short-change us by not paying, and they do not report there because they say they are working outside, and they do not pay there too. So we have to monitor this very, very carefully and as my Hon Colleague said, we\" do need to take cognizance of all these things. We have done it in the past; we would continue to do it.\n But Madam Speaker, I sincerely believe that the time has now come for the Hon Minister for Finance and Economic Planning to do a comprehensive analysis of this and let us know whether these waivers, eventually, are in a way subtracted from the total cost of the project.\n I mean, Madam Speaker, when you look at the projects, the cost for the vehicles and all of them are debited not at the ex- factory prices, but sometimes at the local prices. But at the same time, they want a waiver. So the waiver, I am not so sure, eventually inure to the benefit of the people of Ghana.",

I hope that those sectors which are paying are spared the ordeal during this transition period.\n Mr Speaker, the genesis of this Stabilisation Levy was as a result of the structures in the fiscal space faced by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in fulfilling the obligations that it has set for itself and the Government in the budget, as Ia result of which this levy was put in place, so that that space could be broadened a little.\n What worries me, \u2018Mr Speaker, is that anytime that there is lack of fiscal space, we look only at the revenue side of the balance and tax our people. But the truth of the matter is that any tax which is placed on companies increases the cost of doing business. So this repeal could not have come at a better time when businesses in this country are suffering. So I am very happy that the Government has now repealed this and reduced the burden of taxes on operating concerns in these particular sectors.\n I therefore, support the repeal of the National Fiscal Stabilisation Levy (Repeal) Bill, 2011 (Repeal) and hope that this would be effective immediately to reduce the cost of doing business in those particular sectors.\n I thank you, Mr Speaker.",

So insofar as this Bill seeks to repeal the National Fiscal Stabilistion Levy (Repeal) Bill, 2011, it is in the right direction irrespective of whether it has been spent or not.\n Mr Speaker, you will recall that the Statute Law Review Commission sometime ago. brought a Bill to repeal so many enactments that, in its opinion, had lapsed.

That is why we have to put it in the legal regime.\n Mr Speaker, I support wholeheartedly the reduction in the hospitality industry taxes. We have seen clear evidence from the Committee on Trade and Industry, the effect of that tax removal - L.l. 18 17- had on the hospitality industry. Mr Speaker, that is why it must be a deliberate conscious effort to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to taxes. Mr Speaker, I cannot support wholeheartedly when we say Ghana Stock Exchange should be exempted from five years\u2019 tax.\n Mr Speaker, the track record of the Ghana Stock Exchange has seen people making enormous profits. So, we must be careful to calibrate what we mean by these things. When the current Government came into power, because of certain statements, there was a capital flight and we came into this House to say that we should not scare investors. When you go into the Ghana Stock Exchange, it is these same investors who are the majority players of the Ghana Stock Exchange and here we are again granting them extension of tax holidays.\n So, Mr Speaker, we have to be very careful.
