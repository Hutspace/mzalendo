The Daily\r Graphic, Ghanaian Times, they make\r mistakes all the time. So we should be\r careful the source of the information that\r we put in the Hansard. The Hansard\r should accurately reflect what this House\r knows officially, not what is in the public\r domain, otherwise, we would be heading\r towards trouble.

I raised this matter sometime\r yesterday.\n Madam Speaker, what you are saying\r is entirely correct; however, we transact\r business of government on the floor of\r this House. And my experience in\r government is that, when we even have\r reshuffles, the Hon Ministers who do not\r need to be vetted, do not immediately take\r over. There is usually a time lapse. But it\r is dealt with administratively. It is not\r known by the House but that also creates\r problems for us.\n So, I think in all these things - it may\r help in terms of parliamentary business\r and the conduct of government business\r for the Hon Majority Leader to be able to\r advise the House when the Hon Ministers\r are even supposed to assume duty, even\r though it has not been done in the past.\r It is really not the best. Of course, we may\r take cognisance of public announce-\r ments.\n Now, we know that Hon E. T. Mensah\r is the Hon Minister for Water Resources,\r Works and Housing. Can we recognise\r him? Hon Alban Bagbin is the Hon\r Minister for Health. Probably, in the letters\r advising them, it may not be immediate\r but this House does not know. So, do we\r entertain Hon Bagbin as the Hon Minister\r for Water Resources, Works and\r Housing? So, I am saying that we are\r dealing with governance; as a nation, we\r progress.\n So, the Leadership, together with\r Madam Speaker, may discuss these things\r and find a way which will enable us move\r ahead democratically.

Inasmuch as\r Parliament is the only body that can Waive\r these taxes, I believe that in certain\r instances, the Hon Minister will do well\r to advise us because there is what we call\r double taxation rules that we have.\n With several countries in the world, we\r have double taxation. So if they pay the\r taxes here, they are not supposed to pay\r it in the United Kingdom (UK) or in\r Germany. I myself had the privilege of\r signing some of these - at least,\r initialling them. Therefore, if they say that\r the taxes on the expatriate staff coming\r here are not being paid, what we must make\r sure is Whether they are paying it in their\r country of origin. This is because the\r double taxation, Madam Speaker, really\r means that you pay in Ghana and then\r you do not pay in your country of origin.\n So they short-change us by not paying,\r and they do not report there because they\r say they are working outside, and they\r do not pay there too. So we have to\r monitor this very, very carefully and as\r my Hon Colleague said, we\" do need to\r take cognizance of all these things. We\r have done it in the past; we would\r continue to do it.\n But Madam Speaker, I sincerely believe\r that the time has now come for the Hon\r Minister for Finance and Economic\r Planning to do a comprehensive analysis\r of this and let us know whether these\r waivers, eventually, are in a way\r subtracted from the total cost of the\r project.\n I mean, Madam Speaker, when you look\r at the projects, the cost for the vehicles\r and all of them are debited not at the ex-\r factory prices, but sometimes at the local\r prices.

I hope that those\r sectors which are paying are spared the\r ordeal during this transition period.\n Mr Speaker, the genesis of this\r Stabilisation Levy was as a result of the\r structures in the fiscal space faced by the\r Ministry of Finance and Economic\r Planning in fulfilling the obligations that\r it has set for itself and the Government in\r the budget, as Ia result of which this levy\r was put in place, so that that space could\r be broadened a little.\n What worries me, \u2018Mr Speaker, is that\r anytime that there is lack of fiscal space,\r we look only at the revenue side of the\r balance and tax our people. But the truth\r of the matter is that any tax which is placed\r on companies increases the cost of doing\r business. So this repeal could not have\r come at a better time when businesses in\r this country are suffering. So I am very\r happy that the Government has now\r repealed this and reduced the burden of\r taxes on operating concerns in these\r particular sectors.\n I therefore, support the repeal of the\r National Fiscal Stabilisation Levy\r (Repeal) Bill, 2011 (Repeal) and hope that\r this would be effective immediately to\r reduce the cost of doing business in those\r particular sectors.\n I thank you, Mr Speaker.",
