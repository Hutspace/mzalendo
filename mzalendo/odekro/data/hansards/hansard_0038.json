And my experience in government is that, when we even have reshuffles, the Hon Ministers who do not need to be vetted, do not immediately take over. There is usually a time lapse. But it is dealt with administratively. It is not known by the House but that also creates problems for us.\n So, I think in all these things - it may help in terms of parliamentary business and the conduct of government business for the Hon Majority Leader to be able to advise the House when the Hon Ministers are even supposed to assume duty, even though it has not been done in the past. It is really not the best. Of course, we may take cognisance of public announce- ments.\n Now, we know that Hon E. T. Mensah is the Hon Minister for Water Resources, Works and Housing. Can we recognise him? Hon Alban Bagbin is the Hon Minister for Health. Probably, in the letters advising them, it may not be immediate but this House does not know. So, do we entertain Hon Bagbin as the Hon Minister for Water Resources, Works and Housing? So, I am saying that we are dealing with governance; as a nation, we progress.\n So, the Leadership, together with Madam Speaker, may discuss these things and find a way which will enable us move ahead democratically.

That is, if he goes along, what has been done with respect to Dr Benjamin Kunbuor. And may I know whether the name is \"Kumbuor\" or \"Kunbuor\"? Is it \"m\" or \"n\"? l thought it was \u2018m\u2019 -\"Kumbuor\", and not \"Kunbuor\". [Interruptions] It is K -- u - n? All right.l would want to be educated on that. I have always assumed that the name was \"Kumbuor\", that is with \u2018m\u2019.\n Madam Speaker, so there is that inconsistency regarding how it has been captured. In that case, if he adopts this procedure, then the Minister who was nominated to be responsible for Education ought to have also been appropriately so captured. So that leaves the inconsistency.\n If we have to do that, if we have to resort to that, let us do that, otherwise, we could say that for the Attorney-General and Ministry of Justice, there was nobody responsible to the best, of the knowledge of this House. So for consistency, let us adopt one method and I believe we would be covered.",

We normally take the information in the public domain. But in terms of good practices and having regard to the fact that these days there are mistakes in announcing who goes where, who is even removed, I think that it is in order that the Presidency also sends a list of those who are swapping places to Parliament because many of them do business in this House.\n This is also to indicate when those replacements take effect, so that the issue that was raised by Hon Papa Owusu- Ankomah would be catered for, that this Minister is going there, it takes effect from this day, so that when the Minister comes",

(Dr) (Alhaji) Mustapha Ahmed (retd) and officials from the two sector Ministries and presents this Report.\n 2.0 Background\n Mampong is a growing municipality in the Ashanti Region with current population of 58,000 inhabitants and a huge potential for agro industrial processing. The capacity of the existing water supply system (2,500m3/day) which depends on raw water abstract from River Kyeremfa, a tributary of River Afram is inadequate to meet the increasing demand leading to serious Water supply shortages during the dry season.\n The Mampong water supply system was rehabilitated in 1998. The rehabilitation and expansion of the system is therefore aimed at meeting the demand for potable water in the municipality up to the year 2020 for a projected population of approximately 90,000 people.\n The scope of works, supply for services and the rehabilitation project include:\n\ndesign and engineering;\n\ndredging of impoundment weir to increase storage capacity;\n\nrehabilitation of existing water treatment plant; .\n\nrehabilitation of booster stations;\n\nconstruction of additional 2,500m3/ day Water Treatment Plant;\n\nnew water transmission pipelines;\n\nrehabilitation and extension of distribution network;\n\ninstallation of community stand- pipes;\n\nconstruction of sludge Treatment Facility; and\n\ntechnical and post-construction operational support.\n\nThe project aims at enabling Ghana Water Company Limited enhance access to potable water and improve productivity of the inhabitants.

Inasmuch as Parliament is the only body that can Waive these taxes, I believe that in certain instances, the Hon Minister will do well to advise us because there is what we call double taxation rules that we have.\n With several countries in the world, we have double taxation. So if they pay the taxes here, they are not supposed to pay it in the United Kingdom (UK) or in Germany. I myself had the privilege of signing some of these - at least, initialling them. Therefore, if they say that the taxes on the expatriate staff coming here are not being paid, what we must make sure is Whether they are paying it in their country of origin. This is because the double taxation, Madam Speaker, really means that you pay in Ghana and then you do not pay in your country of origin.\n So they short-change us by not paying, and they do not report there because they say they are working outside, and they do not pay there too. So we have to monitor this very, very carefully and as my Hon Colleague said, we\" do need to take cognizance of all these things. We have done it in the past; we would continue to do it.\n But Madam Speaker, I sincerely believe that the time has now come for the Hon Minister for Finance and Economic Planning to do a comprehensive analysis of this and let us know whether these waivers, eventually, are in a way subtracted from the total cost of the project.\n I mean, Madam Speaker, when you look at the projects, the cost for the vehicles and all of them are debited not at the ex- factory prices, but sometimes at the local prices. But at the same time, they want a waiver. So the waiver, I am not so sure, eventually inure to the benefit of the people of Ghana.\n\nSo I would like to submit that the Hon Minister, fortunately, is here today- our good Friend would do a very comprehensive study of these waivers.

I hope that those sectors which are paying are spared the ordeal during this transition period.\n Mr Speaker, the genesis of this Stabilisation Levy was as a result of the structures in the fiscal space faced by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in fulfilling the obligations that it has set for itself and the Government in the budget, as Ia result of which this levy was put in place, so that that space could be broadened a little.\n What worries me, \u2018Mr Speaker, is that anytime that there is lack of fiscal space, we look only at the revenue side of the balance and tax our people. But the truth of the matter is that any tax which is placed on companies increases the cost of doing business. So this repeal could not have come at a better time when businesses in this country are suffering. So I am very happy that the Government has now repealed this and reduced the burden of taxes on operating concerns in these particular sectors.\n I therefore, support the repeal of the National Fiscal Stabilisation Levy (Repeal) Bill, 2011 (Repeal) and hope that this would be effective immediately to reduce the cost of doing business in those particular sectors.\n I thank you, Mr Speaker.",

Mr Speaker, we intended to have a winnowing with regard to this all-important Bill, but following the developments by way of the reshuffle, it has not been possible for us to do it.\n So, yesterday, the Hon Minority Leader and I and the Committee Chairman and a few other Hon Members met with Justice V. C. R. A. C- Crabbe to undertake the winnowing, but we wanted the complement of the Attorney-General\u2019s Department; either the Hon Minister himself or his Deputy. But as I have indicated, it has not been possible to programme the Hon Minister or his Deputy.\n So I am looking forward to contacting the Minister personally, so that we can arrange a winnowing for next week Tuesday -- we agreed, after which we can take this Bill. So tomorrow, we can look at the Consideration Stage of the Bills of which we have done the Second Reading this afternoon and then we can complete those three Bills tomorrow and the other matters and then next week, we would advise ourselves on the Business Statement.\n Mr Speaker, having said that, I beg to humbly move, that We adjourn the House till tomorrow at 10.00 o\u2019clock in the forenoon.",

But we must take time and allow for some stabilisation to affect governance before we proceed further. Otherwise,\u00bbMr Speaker, nobody knows What we would be heading towards.\n I agree entirely with the Majority Leader for that admission. I guess by next week -",
