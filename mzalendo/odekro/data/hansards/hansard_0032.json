That is\r also symptomatic of the way things are\r organised in this country. I personally\r have had the benefit of being engaged in\r discussions with groups that were on\r strike.\n It is important that on these matters\r the State recognises that there is the need\r for finality so that those who go to\r negotiate feel confident that they have the\r full mandate to take a decision.\n It has happened to me before. Yes, one\r does not have the final decision and one\r may agree tentatively, people are happy,\r then one goes back and they say \"No, we\r cannot handle this\". So it is important\r that all those Who are in a position to give\r clearance should be at the table. I agree\r we have processes but it gets to a stage\r we do not need to go through the entire\r process. All those who are involved can\r be there so that finality can be brought to\r these negotiations.\n It is also important, particularly, having\r regard to what has been going on all over\r the world, to state that probably, as the\r political leadership, there is the need for\r us to have some introspection.

I believe as a nation,\r we are now confronted with how prepared\r we are to undertake emergency disasters\r and to find solutions to them.\n I will first of all like to express my\r condolences to the families who were\r touched \u2018by the loss of life and also\r sympathise with those people who are\r victims of this flooding, which was as a\r result of four to five hours of rain starting\r at midnight when everybody was asleep\r and it continued till the wee hours of the\r morning.\n We are all aware of natural disasters\r but we are also aware that some of these\r disasters come about as a result of failures\r on our part. For instance, we have the\r experience of the Bagri Dam which comes\r yearly and with notification, yet, some\r people are stubborn, when they are told\r to move to higher areas or places that are\r safer, they continue and insist on staying\r in these flood-prone areas.\n I hope we would take lessons from\r some of these happenings. And in recent\r memory, we had the floods that occurred\r in Atiwa, Akwatia, Kade, Fanteakwa and\r parts of Kwabibirem and we know that\r some of these are attributable to the\r galamsey operations being carried out by\r some residents in the area.\n We also had the flooding of the Kumasi\r Market and we know that it was as a result\r of our inability to dispose of garbage in",

Now, and today, we have\r the Accra floods and we have all heard\r the harrowing tales of death, disasters\r and of grief that have been expressed by\r the people in this capital city of ours.\n Why do we have such a monumental\r flooding after four or five hours of rain\r each time this happens\u2018? It is because our\r drains and gutters are choked with filth\r that are man-made; these are not natural\r filths or blockages, these are filth that we\r collect from our homes and some of us\r dump these filth and\u2018 garbage into our\r drains and gutters.\n People have also built in waterways\r and there is also inadequate drainage\r because we have uncovered gutters that\r people find easy to dump these garbage\r in. I think we can have our solutions in\r building more drains, making sure that our\r primary and storm drains are not used as\r garbage sites and dumps. We should also\r put funds aside in our Budget for these\r happenings that we call force majeure.\r There are certain disasters that we cannot\r predict.\n One area that I will call on all of us and\r as a government, to be proactive in, is the\r area of providing funds to Members of\r Parliament and District Assemblies to\r undertake flood control in our areas as\r we did some time ago by giving each\r Member of Parliament, twenty-five million\r old cedis to undertake flood control in the\r constituencies. So that in one breath, we\r had the whole of Ghana being covered by\r our Members of Parliament in their\r contributory aspect of making sure that\r our constituencies are cleared of filth.\n Mr Speaker, we should also equip our\r NADMO officials with enough logistics\r to be able to undertake some of these",

Mr Speaker, I will like to draw\r the attention of all the stakeholders in this\r direction.\n Often, we say that people are building\r in water courses, therefore, we take\r corrective measures by pulling down\r houses that are being built on water\r courses. But Mr Speaker, the question is\r this, if somebody has blocked a water\r course by putting up a house in that place\r and we go and pull it down without\r clearing the debris and all those things\r from the water course what do we expect\r as a country? I think the time has come\r that we have to move beyond demolition\r and go into clearing those areas of water\r courses after the demolition.\n Without doing that, we will end up\r putting ourselves into more danger than\r if we had even allowed that building to be\r there. Mr Speaker, beside that, you go\r round certain places in Accra and you see\r some unauthorised structures that have\r just been destroyed- So instead of\r demolishing and removing the\r unauthorised structures - we are not\r removing unauthorised structures, we are\r demolishing and destroying them. You\r take the road from Achimota to Legon and\r you see kiosks and all unauthorised\r structures that have just been destroyed\r and they are allowed to be there; what do\r We expect?\n Mr Speaker, the second point I will want\r to add is this. When road contractors are\r constructing roads, I think the era has\r come that they may provide a place for\r water to flow away whenever it is raining.\r This current flood issue that we are talking\r of, information reaching me indicate that\r the most hit places are the Graphic Road\r and the Achimota-Ofankor Road where\r construction is taking place and I am told",

What we need is to focus\r on what we want to do, it may cost time,\r money and effort but we can and we must\r solve the problem relating to flooding and\r water locked areas in Accra.\n Mr Speaker, when you go to Holland,\r the Dutch say God created the world but\r the Dutch created Amsterdam, that is\r because they reclaimed land from the sea\r to build on. It is technology, it is\r commitment, it is money but they did it.\n So my view is that, the problems of\r Accra, we all know them, it is time we\r focused, found the appropriate\r technology, paid the cost it requires to fix\r them and fix it.\n Mr Speaker, I think that we have had\r Statements and debates up and down like\r this for far too long. If we found the\r solution now, it becomes an issue - \"Oh\r this Minister did that\", or it is too\r expensive\"; \"it is prolific expenditure\" -\r - does it solve the problem? If it does it\r does, not matter how much it cost, it was\r worth it.\n I wish to urge this House to make a\r strong case to the Executive to find the\r appropriate technology, design the\r appropriate constructional designs, pay\r the cost financially and solve the problem.\n Mr Speaker, this is my little\r contribution.",
