Page 1……8



Mrs Eugenia Gifty Kusi: Madam
Speaker, I am sorry to take you back to
page 3 (III). Yesterday, I did not see Hon
Joe Gidisu in the House. 



Madam Speaker: On page 3?



Mrs Kusi: Madam Speaker, I am
talking about the Hon Minister.
[Interruptions] 



Mr Gershon K. B. Gbediame: Madam
Speaker, the fact that she did not see him
does not mean that he did not come. He
was here. She should not say that
because she did not see him, he did not
come to the House.



Madam Speaker: Yes, Hon Member,
she did not say he did not come. She said
she did not see him. .1 saw him, you saw
him. So, please, she has been corrected.
She did not say he did not come. She
said she did not see him and she has been
told that one does not have to see the
person -- So, let us move on.



Page 8…… 18 –



Oh! Yes, Hon Member. 



Dr Owusu Afriyie Akoto: Madam
Speaker, I think somebody is strenuously
trying to misspell or mix-up my name and

[752]

this is not the first time. The last time was
when we had a meeting of the Committee
on Food and Agriculture and Cocoa
Affairs, Wl'l1Cl'l was reported in the Votes
and Proceedings. By the time I came, it
had been done with.



Today, it is still a consistent mistake
on page 17, item 2 - "Attendance (V). I
am being referred to as "Dr Afiiyie Owusu
Akoto" which is incorrect. Madam
Speaker, Afriyie" is my middle name,
"Owusu" IS my first name and my surname
is "Akoto." So, it should be Owusu
Afriyie Akoto" and Madam Speaker, with
your indulgence, if those corrections
could be made to - I do not have the
reference number and the date but at the
last reporting of the Committee on Food
and Agriculture -~ the "Attendance", I
will be very grateful if the corrections can
be made again. 



Thank you very much



Madam Speaker: Thank you and
notice taken.

Prof. (Emeritus) Samuel K.Amoako:
Madam Speaker, page 19 under item 2,
"Attendance". The name of the former
Minister for Health has been misspelled;
(vi%1_- "Mr Joseph Yieleh Chireh . The
‘ Cireh" is not correctly spelt.



Madam Speaker: What should it have
been?



Prof (Emeritus) Amoako: Madam
Speaker, it should be "C-h-i-r-e-h";

Madam Speaker: Thank you.



Page 20 - [Pause]



Hon Members, the Votes and
Proceedings of Wednesday, 8* February,
2012 as corrected are adopted as the true
record of proceedings.



There will be no Statements. 



Hon Leader, shall we move on to
Commencement of Public Business and
the Laying of Papers?

[753]

Dr Anthony A. Osei: Madam Speaker,
I just need your guidance.



On page 13, there is a report that there
was a meeting of the joint Committee on
Finance, Mines and Energy –



Madam Speaker: Page I3?



Dr A. A. Osei: Page 13 in t0day‘s,
there is an advertisement that we are
meeting again. Madam Speaker,
something arose out of the meeting that - I
need your guidance on.



One of the tasks before us was to
review the science version of the Master
Facility Agreement. Madam Speaker, in
reviewing it, it has come out that what
was approved by Parliament is not what
has been signed and there are a few
places that I can cite.



In the light of the fact that it has been
approved by Parliament and has been
changed, does the Committee have any
basis for continuing our deliberations? It
is a very difficult matter and I thought it
was better We raise it here because
Leadership was tasked to review it. But
having found that that is the case, I do
not believe that I should wait till we go
there and pretend that we have a basis
for going forward- I thought I would raise
it with you, so that we know how to
proceed.



Madam Speaker: Yes, Hon Avedzi,
any comment on this?



Mr James K. Avedzi: Madam Speaker,
yesterday, we demanded the executed
copy of the MFA and we agreed at the
committee level, that the leadership of the
Committee should review it. If we notice
any changes, we would ask for
explanation from the Ministry.



Madam Speaker, we have not done
such a thing and I am surprised that this
issue is on the floor here because we are
asked as leadership to review the thing,

[754]

we have not sat down to do that. If the
Hon Member has noticed it, I thought it
would be proper for him to draw my
attention, then we consult the Ministry
and find out the reason before bringing
it here. So, Madam Speaker, I am highly
surprised about the conduct of the Hon
Ranking Member. 



Madam Speaker: Well, I really see
nothing wrong by drawing the House’s
attention and asking how We will solve it.
This is the business of the whole House,
whatever happens in committee or inside
this House is a business for the Whole
House. Is it not it? So by drawing your
attention, I was rather going to say that --
he is asking me for my views and I have
not seen it to say there was a difference
and I am not going to take Not that I
do not accept what he is saying. 



But before I decide on What you have
asked as my view, I want to see what the
changes were.- That was what I said. But
what he said, I disagree of that



Dr A. A. Osei: Madam Speaker, there
was a Whole list. It is a whole list of items
that I have here and if you ask me, I will
give you. But Madam Speaker, in reference
to him saying that we were going to ask
the Ministry-4 Nobody said we should
ask the Ministry. If a change has been
made, it is not the Ministry’s business, it
is the business of this House. We
approved the document. So if I see a
change, I do not go to the Ministry to ask
them.



It is a parliamentary approval and not
a Ministerial approval. If Parliament says
pay GH¢400,000 and the Ministry
changes it to GH¢500,000, they do not
have any business changing it. Why do I
go to ask them?



Madam Speaker: Hon Osei, it could
be that there was a typographical error.
That is why he is saying, let us approach
the Ministry to find out.

[755]

Dr A. A. Osei: Madam Speaker, it is
not typographical. 



Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Madam
Speaker, I believe that this is a matter for
the Committee and not the Ranking and
the Chair. It is a matter for the Committee
and they will take a decision on it. So lam
urging the Ranking Member and the
Chairman- [Interruptions] - No, I am
saying it as a Member of Parliament; let
us do things right.



I am saying that Whatever is happening
is not for the Ranking Member and the
Chairman to discuss and decide what to
do, it is the Committee’s decision. So, I
will urge the Ranking Member and the
Chairman of the Committee to come and
report to the Committee and let us take a
decision in the light of the Constitution
and the Standing Orders.



Oftentimes, mistakenly, when matters
are referred to the leadership of the
Committee, they think that it is the
leadership that has to take that decision.
No. It is the Committee and I would
want to put this on record. But in any
event, what Parliament has approved, no
one except Parliament can change it.



Mr Cletus A. Avoka: Madam Speaker,
let us curtail this matter. The matter is
before the Committee. Let them examine
it and appraise us as he has indicated. We
are doing "Correction of Votes and
Proceedings It is useful that he has
drawn our attention but if the Committee
is still sorting out, we should give it the
opportunity to sort out and let us know
later.



So I think that We should go ahead with
the "Correction of the Votes and
Proceedings In fact, we had concluded
and we were about to go to Public
Business when he raised the issue. So
our attention has been drawn to it. It is
still a matter before the Committee.



Thank you.

[756]

Madam Speaker; We thank you for
raising it and the answers we got. We
apprise ourselves everyday of the proper
things to do. So it is in order that we have
been told that the Committee is - if there
is something, we will inform the House.



Let us move on to item 4. 



Mr Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu:
Madam Speaker, I think as the Majority
Leader has indicated, the Committee
started deliberation on the referral
yesterday and it has been captured in the
Votes and Proceedings for yesterday.
Today, the Committee is going to
continue. I think in the light of what the
Ranking Member is saying, the Committee
could come to some determination.



If, indeed, there has been some
changes, then certainly, the Committee
cannot continue. If there has been any
change in the approved document, the
committee cannot continue and pretend
that nothing has happened. It will have
to come back to Parliament.



Madam Speaker, I think that should be
the position.



I also think that when the Chairman said
of the Ranking Member’s intervention
that he was surprised at the conduct of
him, I Want to believe that the intendment
of that issue was not to question the
conduct of the Ranking Member in this.
This is because if indeed, that ‘is the
intendment, it offends our Orders.
Standing Order 93 (3) states, and Madam
Speaker, with your permission, I beg to
quote:



"It shall be out of order to attempt
to reconsider any specific Question
upon which the House has come to
a conclusion during the current
Session, except upon a substantive
Motion for rescission".



11.15a.m.



Mr Avedzi: Madam Speaker, I said I
was surprised because, the agreement
that we reached yesterday was for the two

[757]

[MR AVEDZI] 

of us to "review the executed copy of the
MFA, look for explanation and report back
to the Committee. We have not done that
but it has been brought to the floor of the
House. That was why I said I was
surprised about the conduct of the Hon
Ranking Member. So it was not done with
a proper motive because what we have
agreed on, was not followed.
[Interruptions] 



Madam Speaker: Order! Order!



I think this matter should be laid to test.
The Hon Member has explained that he
was not attacking his conduct but that
both had agreed that they would look at
it. Shall we not leave it there?



Hon Dr A. A. Osei, would you not take
that as an explanation?



Dr A. A. Osei: Madam Speaker, I will
not try to take offence at What my Hon
Chairman of the Committee has said.
When I got up, I said I needed guidance.
When I need guidance from you, Madam
Speaker, l do not need to consult the
Chairman. It is such an important matter
that I had to get guidance from you and
not from him.



Madam Speaker, how many times does
he do things without consulting me? He
should not be going into that area; that is
the point. He should not be imputing
things that cannot be true.



Madam Speaker: Shall we leave it
here? Do not be surprised at too many
things; that is what the Hon Member is
saying. We consult - the work in
Chambers and in the House. is the work of
all of us and that is how I came in. Let us
find out what has happened first, then
we report on it.



I thank you Hon Members.

Dr Owusu A. Akoto: Madam Speaker,
I am just curious. Talking about the

[758]

correction on page l3- [interruptions]
Madam Speaker, this is very important. In
attendance are Hon Members and I see a
strange name " Ms Christina S. Y.
Nkrumah". Is she a Member of
Parliament? I am not sure. 



Madam Speaker: Do you mean page

13?



Dr Akoto: I am sorry, Madam Speaker.
I withdraw. [Laughter.]



Madam Speaker: Thank you, anyway
for bringing it to our attention.
Shall we now finally move to --' Hon
Leader, please, let us correct the Official
Report first.



Mr Avoka: Madam Speaker, very well.



Madam Speaker: Hon Members, let us
correct the Official Report of 3rd February,

2012.



Any corrections?



Prof. (Emeritus) Amoako: Madam
Speaker, column 505, the last paragraph,
first line, my name has been wrongly spelt.
My surname is spelt as "A-m-o-a-k-o".



Then again, Madam Speaker, column
506, the third line, the last word on that
line "Are there two separate reports or the
same report?" not "Are they" The "they…”
should be "t-h-e-r-e".



Madam Speaker: Any other corrections?-



Hon Members, the Official Report of
Friday, 3" February, 2012 as corrected,
represents the true record of proceedings.
Hon Leader, we are now ready to move
to item 4. Where is the Chairman of the
Committee? We have Papers to be
presented.

[759]

Mr Avoka: Madam Speaker, are we on
item 4 of the Order Paper? It should be the
Hon Minister for Local Government and
Rural Development and not Chairman of
the Committee. 



Madam Speaker: Item 4 (a), Minister
for Local Government and Rural
Development.



11.25.am.

By the Chairman of the Committee –



Report of the Committee on
Constitutional, Legal and
Parliamentary Affairs on the United
Nations Convention Against
Transnational Organised Crime
(Palermo) and the Protocols thereto.



Mr Avoka: Madam Speaker, I propose
that we go to item number 7 at page 9. We
continue with the Consideration Sage of
the Presidential (Transition) Bill, 2010.



Madam Speaker: Yes, so we move on
to item number 7 –



Consideration Stage will be continued
by the Hon First Deputy Speaker.



11.42 A.M. 



[MR FIRST DEPUTY SPEAKER IN THE

CHAIR]



Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, originally, it
was our contemplation to continue with
the Consideration Stage of the
Presidential (Transition) Bill, 2010 but in

[770]

view of the other challenges that we have,
the other programmes that we have, this
Bill is being piloted by Leadership,
particularly the Hon Minority Leader and
myself and a few others. He is a member
of the vetting committee where you will
also have to be going very soon.



So I was wondering whether we can
take item number 5, which is just the
principles of the Colleges of Education Bill,
even for about 30 minutes, so that we can
then release the Hon Minority Leader and
a few others who are going for the vetting.



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Yes, it is
true; the Appointments Committee will be
meeting today for the public hearing of
some of the nominees of His Excellency
the President. So we take item number 5.



Mr Avoka: Yes, it is just the principles
and it would not be a long debate; it is a
short one. So we can take that one –



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Then we
can take an adjournment.



Mr Avokaz That is so.



11.45a.m. 



Mr First Deputy Speaker: C Hon
Members, item number 5 on the Order Paper
- Minister for Education?



Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, I would humbly
want to apply for the Hon Deputy Minister
for Education, Hon Mahama Ayariga to
move the Motion for and on behalf of the
substantive Minister who assumed
responsibility just yesterday and
therefore, has not tuned himself to this
Bill. Indeed, it is the Hon Deputy Minister
who has been engaged constructively in
piloting this Bill. So I would Want to apply
to you to permit him to move this Motion
for and on behalf of the Hon Minister.



Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
the Hon Majority Leader is drawing
attention that the substantive Minister

[771]

[MR KYEI-MENSAH-BONSU]



assumed office just yesterday. There is
no substantive Minister, so nobody could
have assumed office yesterday. So that
information is incorrect. 

'

Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, Hon E. T
Mensah, Minister for Employment and
Social Welfare is acting.



Mr First Deputy Speaker: The point
being made by the Hon Minority Leader
is that he is not a substantive Minister;
he is acting. He is not a substantive
Minister at that Ministry.



Very well, subject to that correction, I
will call on the Hon Deputy Minister for
Education to move the Motion, item 5 on
the Order Paper.



BILLS--SECOND READING



Colleges of Education Bill, 2011



Deputy Minister for Education (Mr
Mahama Ayariga) (on behalf of the
Acting Minister for Education): Mr
Speaker, I beg to move, that the Colleges
of Education Bill, 2011 be now read a
Second time.



Mr Speaker, in moving the Motion,
permit me to state briefly the principles
informing this Bill - [Interruption.]



Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu --rose–-



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon
Minority Leader, do you have a point of
order?



Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: That is so,
Mr Speaker.



Mr Speaker, the Bill before us is the
"College, of Education Bill, 201 1." I know
it was intended to read "Colleges of
Education Bill, 2011". So if the Hon
Deputy Minister wants to amend it -
and I believe we all agree --he must state
so but he should not assume that the Bill
before us is "Colleges of Education Bill,
2011. It is not

[772]

Mr. Ayariga: Thank you very much,
Mr. Speaker.



Mr Speaker,-with your indulgence, I do
not know if this is the stage at which it
would be, properly speaking, right to
amend the heading of the Bill. So Mr
Speaker- 



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon
Deputy Minister, what you have to do is
that you amend the Motion. You amend
the Motion now because you cannot
amend - We are not at the Consideration
Stage. When we reach the there, then if
you want to amend the Long Title, the
Short Title and all those things, we would
look at it there. But the Motion that you
are moving –



Mr Ayariga: Mr Speaker, with your
kind permission, I wish to amend the
Motion to read that "The Colleges of
Education Bill, 20 l 1, be now read a Second
time.



Mr Speaker in - [Interruption]



Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
the Hon Deputy Minister for Education
has stated that he wishes to move - I am
waiting for when he would really move. It
is only a declaration of intent. Let him tell
us when he wants to do it and if we have
to support it, we would support it. For
now, it is only a mere declaration of intent.



Mr Ayariga: Mr Speaker, I beg to
move, that the Colleges of Education Bill,
201 1 be now read a Second time.



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon
Minority Leader, he can amend the
Motion on the Order Paper. Yes, he can
amend it.



Mr Ayariga: Mr Speaker, my first step
was to move an amendment to the Motion
to now read "Colleges of Education Bill,
2011". Having moved that one --
[Interruption] -- Mr Speaker, my
understanding is that I would have to wait
for it to be seconded and accepted -

[773]

Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon
Deputy Minister, what you are doing is
that you have realized that there is an error,
so you are informing the House that it
should have been "Colleges of Education
Bill, 201 1" and therefore, there should be
an "s" at the end of "College" so that the
House would take note. 



But that amendment does not affect
what is in the Bill. But at least, you are
giving us notice. Then when we come to
the Consideration Stage, it becomes more
or less consequential, then we would do
the necessary corrections.



Mr Ayariga: Thank you very much.
Mr Speaker, precisely so.



So Mr Speaker, I am drawing the
attention of the House that the Motion is
supposed to be "Colleges," with "s" at
the end of "College. So it should be
"Colleges of Education Bill, 2011" be now
read a Second time.



I beg to move. 



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon
Minister, have you finished with your
submission? You have informed the
House, so now we know that it should
have been "Colleges of Education Bill,
201 1". It is important. So move the Motion
and after that the Chairman of the
Committee on Education would come in.



Actually, what you are doing is
correcting it to read "Colleges of
Education Bill, 2011" and then you go
ahead to move the Motion, and then the
Chairman of the Education Committee
submits his Committee’s Report; after
that, the debate - Have you finished
moving the Motion?

[774]

Mr Ayariga: Mr Speaker, in moving
the Motion, I would want to state _the
objectives and principles informing this
Bill.



Mr Speaker, in the White Paper on the
Report of the Education Reforms Review
Committee, it was decided that we should
upgrade the teacher training colleges to
tertiary status as part of a comprehensive
programme to improve upon the quality
of teachers who teach at the pre-tertiary
level.



Mr Speaker, it is this objective that has
informed or necessitated the bringing to
this House of a Bill which seeks to
upgrade the 38 teacher training colleges
that we have in the country to tertiary
status, so that they would now become
diploma awarding institutions.’ Mr
Speaker, it would affect the governance
structures of the various colleges of
education and it would also affect the
quality of the teachers and lecturers of
the various colleges, of education.



Mr Speaker, there are other issues that
would be affected by the upgrading of the
teacher training colleges to the colleges
of education as we presently have them
and if this Bill is passed, Mr Speaker, we
would have improved institutions-for the
training of our teachers who would be
teaching at the pre-tertiary level, mostly
our basic schools.



On that note, Mr Speaker, I. end my
submission.



11.55a.m.



Question proposed

Mathia-A. Puozaa): Mr Speaker, I rise to

4.0 Background information



In the White Paper issued by the
Government on the report of the
Education Reform Review Committee by
the then Ministry of Education, Youth and
Sports in October 2004, the Government
stated its commitment to improve teacher
education so as to be able to provide
quality teaching. In fulfillment of this
commitment, it was instructed that the
Ministry of Education takes steps to

[777]

[MR PUOZAA]



upgrade the existing teacher training
colleges to tertiary education level to
produce teachers who can impact required
skills and knowledge to the children.



5.0 The purpose of the Bill



This Bill, therefore, seeks to upgrade
teacher training colleges to the status of
colleges of education to be able to meet
the challenges of the day.



6.0 Divisions of the Bill



The Bill is divided into four main
sections namely:



Establishment, aims and functions
Administrative provisions.
Financial provisions.
Miscellaneous.



7.0 Highlights of the clauses of the Bill



The Bill consists of 33 clauses. Clause
1 deals with the establishment of colleges
of education and clause 2 deals with the
status of colleges of education. The aims
of a college of education are provided for
in clause 3 and these include the training
of students to acquire the necessary
professional and academic competencies
for teaching in pre-tertiary institutions and
non-formal education institutions.



The functions of a college of education
which is to provide teacher education to
citizens who are interested in the teaching
profession and to award diplomas and
other certificates accredited by the
National Accreditation Board through
affiliation with higher chartered teaching
institutions are provided for in clause 4.

[778]

Clauses Sand 6 provide for the
governing body of the colleges, which is
a Council and its functions respectively.
The functions among others shall include
determining the policies, over-seeing the
internal organization and managing the
finances and fixed assets of the college.
Clauses 7, 8, 9, 10 and ll deal with the
tenure of office, meetings, disclosure of
interest, establishment of sub-committees
and allowances of Council members
respectively. 



The general powers of the Council are
provided for in clause 12. The principal
officers of a college of education are
clearly named in clause 13 and they are
the College Principal, College Vice-
Principal and College Secretary and their
functions are provided for in clause 14 to

17.



While clause 18 provides for the
internal organization of a college of
education, clause 19 empowers a college
of education to enact codes to determine
procedure for discipline of students and
staff and the assessment and the award
of diplomas and other qualifications of the
college. Clause 20 states the procedure
for enacting codes and clause 21
provides for the Students’ Representative
Council.



Clause 22 to 27 deal with an Academic
Board. The composition of the Board is
provided for in clause 23. Clause 24
states the functions of the Board which
shall include the formulation and
implementation of the academic policies
of the college in consultation with an
affiliate institution as well as the
determination of academic standards,
validation and review of courses.



Committees and meetings of the Board
are dealt with in clauses 25 and 26. Clause
27 deals with academic, administrative and
other bodies of the college.

[779]

[MR PUOZAA]



The sources and management of funds
of a college of education is provided for
in clause 28 and consist of subventions
approved by Parliament, tuitions and
boarding fees, gifts, endowment, grants,
investment and moneys from other
sources approved by the College Council.
Clause 29 deals with account and audit
while clause 30 deals with annual report
and other reports.



Miscellaneous provisions are dealt
with in clause 3 I to 33. Clause 31 provides
for regulations and finally, clauses 32 and
33 deal with interpretations and
transitional provisions respectively.



8.0 Observations



8.1 The award of degrees/certificates



It was observed that provision has
been made in clause 4(g) of the Bill for
the award of certificates including
degrees. The Committee further observed
that there are in existence a number of
Chartered teacher education institutions
awarding degrees in the country and
therefore, recommends that the colleges
of education should be restricted to
running of programmes leading to the
award of diplomas and other certificates
accredited by the National Accreditation
Board.



8.2 Affiliation to chartered institutions
of teachers education



Again, it was observed in clause 3 that
one of the core objectives for the
upgrading of the teacher training colleges
to the college of education is to produce
professional and competent teachers
capable of imparting quality skills and
knowledge to students at the pre-tertiary
and non-formal education institutions. For
the realization of this objective, the

[780]

Committee recommends that the colleges
of education should affiliate to the already
existing chartered teacher education
institutions in the country for proper
supervision and guidance.



8.3 Term of office of the Principal



The Committee further noted that there
was no specified term of office for the
College Principal as pertains in the other
tertiary institutions such as the
universities and polytechnics. It is,
therefore, proposed that the College
Principal holds office for a period of four
years but eligible for re-appointment for
another term only.



8.4 Representation of the affiliate
institution on the Council Body



Under the interpretation section
(clause 32) of the Bill, the University of
Education, Winneba and University of
Cape Coast have been mentioned as the
two institutions to be affiliated to by all
the colleges of education. The Committee
noted that a college of education may
have to be affiliated to one or two
institutions depending on the type of
programmes being run.



The Committee, therefore, recommends
that a representative from each of
these universities‘ serve on the Council of
any college so affected.

Committee proposes the following

10 Recommendations and conclusion



The significance of the Colleges of
Education Bill cannot be overemphasis ed.
It seeks not only to enhance the status of
the present teacher training colleges but
also to enhance the image of basic
education teachers. The upgrading is thus
intended to provide the teacher trainees
improved teaching and learning skills,
which will also reflect in the performance
of students in terms of knowledge and
skills acquisition.



The Committee, therefore, unanimously
Recommends to this Honourable
House to pass the Colleges of Education
Bill, 2011 into an Act subject to the
additional amendments proposed above.



Respectfully submitted.



Ranking Memeber of the Committee
(Prof. Dominic K. Fobih): Mr. Speaker, I
would like to contribute to the Motion on
the floor and make a few comments.

[791]

[PROF FOBIH]



First, it must be clear that these
colleges are not to train teachers for pre-
tertiary levels as the Hon Deputy Minister
said. They are meant-to train teachers for
basic education. It is the universities of
education which train teachers for
second-cycle institutions. That point must
be clear. That is what I wanted to rise up
and clear.



Now, we know that the Bill is dealing
with the upgrading of the 3 8 former teacher
training colleges of which 15 are
designated as specialist institutions. But
we do know well that under the Free,
Compulsory, Universal Basic Education
(FCUBE) policy, these colleges which
trained teachers for basic education were
to be diploma awarding institutions. But
not until 2008, there was no legitimacy to
this function that they are expected to
play. It was the Education Act,,2008 (Act
775) which gave properly, recognition and
legitimacy to the upgrading of these
institutions.



For that reason, a lot of their
infrastructure was also upgraded
accordingly. For the first time, we had
proper laboratories built in these colleges
by the Kuffuor Administration. We had
proper library facilities and classrooms,
dormitories for students and the principals
were equally motivated by giving them 4x4
Nissan Patrol vehicles. So, in my view, the
passage of the Bill has come rather too
late. Too late because the FCUBE policy
came in the 90s and the Education Act
was passed in 2008.



Even after that a lot of background work
was done with this Bill, which I thought
should not have taken three years for it to
actually come to this House.

[792]

Nevertheless, I would say better late
than never. This is because the passage
of the Bill will give legitimacy to the status
of these institutions as diploma awarding
institutions and also strengthen their
existence as tertiary institutions.



In doing so, however, I would like to
mention that attention should be given to
the following; 



Firstly, they will require additional
infrastructure which befits their status as
tertiary institutions. And here, I mean that
proper lecture rooms, instead of the
traditional rooms should be the order of
the day for them. 



12.05p.m.



Then there should also be offices for
the senior members, that is, the academic
staff, unlike before _when they were
considered like our basic schools and
therefore, the staff had no offices and all
that. 



Secondly, they should adopt proper
administrative structures and tertiary
budgeting procedures. This is because
now that they are "tertiary", their whole
character should look like tertiary
institutions and I think all the structures
that would be required have to be taken
into account in order to make them proper
tertiary institutions.



It is not like before when Teacher
Education Division of Ghana Education
Service was just allocating funds for them
to carry out their Work without proper
budgeting procedures,‘ which had been
laid down for tertiary institutions.
Thirdly, I would say that they should
be encouraged to wean themselves
properly from the Teacher Education
Division of the Ghana Education Service
and a new kind of working relationship
should be carved out for them, so that
they exist in their own rights.

[793]

[PROF FOBIH]



Mr Speaker, I think one other critical
issue I would like to bring to our attention
is page (3), paragraph (h) (i) of the Report,
under "Observations". I think the future
of the 38 colleges has not been given
proper attention or has not been properly
addressed. Certainly, the country cannot
afford the luxury of having 38 colleges
become university colleges and
consequently become autonomous
institutions with separate budgeting and
other related matters.



We can also not stifle the growth and
development of these institutions and
expect that they would remain so forever.
So I think that the future growth of the
institutions should be properly
engineered, such that there is a proper
restructuring and reorganisation and a
clear path set before them at this critical
stage of their development, so that we do
not leave everything to chance and
arbitrary decision making, but rather a
properly setout plan. 



Finally, on paragraph 8(ii) of your
Report, I would suggest that it is
important to ensure that the affiliation
recommended is strictly followed. It is a
measure to ensure a universal credibility
to the diploma credentials they may award
and also avoid the predicament of the early
polytechnic Higher National Diploma
(HND) holders whose status was unclear.



With these few words, I would support
the Motion. 



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon
Ranking Member, the Report indicated
that they would award degrees. What
kind of degrees would they award‘?
[Pause]



Hon Minister for Communication
Alhaji?



Minister for Communications Alhaji Haruna Iddrisu)
(MP): Mr Speaker, thank
you very much for the opportunity to

[794]

associate myself with the Motion ably
moved by the Hon Deputy Minister, Hon
Mahama Ayariga and in doing so, to refer
you to paragraph 8(ii), page (4) of your
Committee’s Report.



Mr Speaker, in doing so, I would relate
the same paragraph to paragraph 8 (iv) of
the Co1rnnittee‘s Report, and with your
indulgence, I beg to quote:



"Again, it was observed in clause
(3) that one of the core objectives
for the upgrading of the teacher
training colleges to colleges of
education is to produce
professionals ..."



Mr Speaker, I am interested in the last
line.



"...should affiliate to the already
existing chartered teacher education
institutions in the country."



Mr Speaker, the Committee must offer
some additional explanation, whether or
not there exists even in this country,
chartered teacher education institutions.



Mr Speaker, why I am raising this is
that when we come to paragraph 8 (iv) of
the same Committee’s Report, we are again
told that affiliation should be to the
University of Education, Winneba and the
University of Cape Coast. That is
appropriate and that we should
recommend it as a Committee but not the
chartered teacher education institutions.
So I indulge the Hon Chairman that if he
has no objection to the Committee, I do
not know -- Even if they are chartered,
that is not what is to be affiliated with -
[Interruption.]



Papa Owusu-Ankornah: Mr Speaker,
on a point of order.



Mr Speaker, we know by our laws that
a tertiary institution should be chartered.
So the Universities of Cape Coast and
Education, Winneba are chartered
institutions for training teachers.

[795]

Mr Mahama Ayariga: Mr Speaker, I
think that is not entirely accurate. The
current universities running programmes
leading to the award of degrees that are
for professional teachers are public
universities established by law. Chartered
universities are private universities that
have received presidential charter after
they have met all the requirements of
chartering.



So one cannot say that the University
of Cape Coast,--which is by‘ law
established and one of its functions is to
train professional teachers, is a chartered
university. No, it is a university all right.
But it is not a chartered university
according to the law establishing the
National Accreditation Board –



Mr First Deputy Speaker: The
question is not whether it is a chartered
university, but whether it is a chartered
teacher education institution. That is the
language of the Committee’s Report.



Mr Ayariga: Mr Speaker, I think that
the intention of the Committee is to make
reference to the University of Cape Coast,
the University of Education, Winneba, et
cetera. But the use of the word
"chartered" there is an inappropriate
expression. Strictly speaking, bylaw, we
all understand them to intend to refer to
the University of Cape Coast and the
University of Education, Winneba. A
better way would have been "mandated"
to train teachers, not "chartered" to train
teachers, strictly speaking.



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, while we contribute to this
debate, I want you to clarify the position
which the Committee’s Report has
captured; it is in the Bill, that colleges of
education will award degrees- Would
they award PhD Degrees‘? Would they
award Masters Degrees, so that we are
very clear in our minds what type of
degrees we are talking about.



Alhaji H. Iddrisu: Mr Speaker, mine
is not to raise issues on conflict; what we
do want is an improvement on the
Committee’s Report and clarity that the
institutions they are referring to are the
University of Education, Winneba and the
University of Cape Coast that are known
in Ghana as respectful institutions that
undertake professional teacher education.



The Committee could have best
merged paragraphs 8 (ii) and (iv) and even
named those institutions before saying
those chartered teacher education
institutions - so that we would have had
a better comprehension of it. But Mr
Speaker, just to respond to the issue you
have raised, I noted that paragraph 8 (i) of
your Committee’s Report and with your
permission, I beg to quote:



"It was observed that provisions
have been made in clause 4 (g) of
the Bill for the award of certificates
including degrees- The Committee
further observed there are in
existence a number of chartered
_ teacher education institutions
awarding degrees in the country
and therefore, recommended that
the colleges of education should be
restricted to running of programmes
leading to award of diplomas and
other certificates."



So my understanding is that the
Committee itself would not even agree
with the provision in the Bill that colleges
of education must award degrees. They
would be upgraded to tertiary status but
restricted to diplomas and certificates that
have the approval of the National
Accreditation Board.



Mr Speaker, let me also join in
commending, in-particular, Prof. Ivan
Addai-Mensah and Prof. Djangmah. I
think that when it comes to the literature

[797]

[ALHAJI H. IDDRlSU]



of basic education, we are not found
wanting at all as a country .This is because
of their professional input and their
interests. We should go further even to
the recommendations of the various
committees that have been set up to seek
to improve education generally in Ghana.



The truth is that the quality of
education is ‘on the decline. Issues of
gender parity, even though they are being
addressed at the highest level, there are
still gaps. If we go into those experts’
recommendations, we will find answers to
improve the quality of education generally
and particularly teachers. Mine in respect
of teachers, is to say that they should
begin taking advantage of Information,
Communication and Technology (ICT).



Today, when they are training our
children at the basic level, they will be
competing with the rest of the world and
it is important that they get exposure to
ICT in order that they can improve their
own lot and we will support the teacher
training education in order to be able to
do this.



With these few comments, Mr Speaker,
I associate myself with the Motion. 



l2.l5 p.m.



Mrs Gifty E. Kusi: (NPP --Tarkwa-
Nsuaem): Mr Speaker, I rise to support
the Motion on the floor to approve the
Committee‘s Report on the Colleges
Education Bill, 2011.



Mr Speaker, I would want to support
the Committee’s Report which says that
College Principals should be made to hold
office for a period of four years but they
are also recommending that the Vice~
Principal should hold office for three
years. 



I would want the Committee to consider
the number of years, so that the Principal
and the Vice will have four years instead

[798]

of reducing the Vice’s to three years. I do
not know, maybe, they will have a reason.
The Hon Deputy Minister can explain
when he is winding up.



Mr Speaker, I would also want to say
on award of degrees-- They say they
want to restrict them only to diplomas
because there are other institutions that
award degrees. The institutions are few;
so if they would even upgrade them and
make sure that some do award degrees
and some graduate when the developing
of the country gets to a state that we can
accommodate that, it will be better. This is
because the population of the country is
growing so big and private universities
are springing up here and there. So if
government universities "would be
increased as time goes on, I think that
will also be good. So these are my
comments.



I thank you, Mr Speaker, for the
opportunity.



MS Beatrice B. Boateng (NPP --New
Juaben South): Mr Speaker, I thank you
for the opportunity given me to add my
voice to the Motion on floor, that is, the
Colleges of Education Bill , 2011.



Mr Speaker, I would want to thank the
Hon Minister and the Hon Chairman for
ably moving this Motion‘ and I would
also want to thank God for having the
asset of saying that it is better late than
never. This proposal, I believe, has been
too late but thank God, whatever it is, it
has now come to the fore. It has today
seen the light and I believe the lecturers
and teachers concerned would want me
to convey their appreciation to the House
for how far we have brought this thing.



I know the number of Motions, the
number of memoranda, the number of
letters, personal interactions that have
gone into having this Bill being moved
to day for a Second Reading and I would
want to appreciate all those concerned
who have made this a reality.

[799]

[MS BOATENG]



Mr Speaker, I would want to commend
all of us for the time we have spent in
coming up with this Bill and to say that it
is not for anything that certain
observations have been made and these
observations include the award of degrees
or certificates. For this, we are saying that
for now and for a start, we should restrict
them to the award of diplomas and other
certificates, hoping that with time, we
could go ahead to improve upon what we
have now. So that is that.



Mr Speaker, we have also talked about
affiliation. I am very much concerned
about this affiliation issue because just
this morning, we have heard and read that
some students in one of our private
universities, almost 700, have been asked
to go home for not having the entry
requirements.



The question is, how did they find their
way into the universities? What were the
criteria that were put down by the affiliated
institutions that were guiding them? If
they were going strictly by them, why will
this thing happen to confuse a lot of
students, their parents and the country
as a whole? Huge fees and the like - I
spoke on one of the radio stations and
proposed that if they had agreed to refund
their moneys to them, it should not be just
the moneys they have given to them.



They should charge them on the
prevailing interest rate‘ and then they
should also consider the emotional
trauma, other problems that they might
have associated with --- the
embarrassment --- and pay whatever they
are to them. It is for this reason that I am
also trying to stress that these ‘colleges
of education, as they come into being,
should take every observation that we
have made to the letter and they should
go strictly by the affiliated institutions,

[800]

what they have set up for them, so that
we do not have a situation of this nature
happening again.



Mr Speaker, I also think that there are a
few things that the Hon Ranking Member
has enumerated as needs to put them on
their feet. They are very necessary. But
then we also expect the Board, whoever
is in charge of running this institution, to
also move ahead. They should be
innovative enough to try to come out with
good things, to be seen to be new wine in
a new bottle and not new wine in an old
bottle, so that sooner, we would have very
progressive colleges of education in the
offing. 



Mr Speaker, I am also trying to say that
Government should also play its part. We
do not like the lip-service that normally
characters a lot of things that we do here.
We really Want to see things happening.
If it is infrastructure, they should be put
forward quickly, so that they start
working. If it is managerial things, they
should be put in place to see them start
work as soon as possible, so that all these
efforts that we have put in to come that
far with this Bill, will not be in vain. I
would want to congratulate all and urge
the House to move for its acceptance
when it comes to the final Vote.



Mr Speaker, thank you for ,this
opportunity.



12.25p.m.



Mr Theophilus T. Chaie (NDC -
Ablekuma Central): Mr Speaker, I am very
happy that today this issue is before
Parliament and at the end of the day, Hon
Members of the House will unanimously
approve this Bill before the House.



Mr Speaker, looking at our colleges of
education, they lack so many amenities
that can enhance teaching and learning

[801]

[MR CHAIE]



in this country and l believe that the
upgrading of the colleges of education to
a tertiary status will not only be in the
form of legislation but then it will also help
to provide the needed infrastructure to
enhance teacher education within the
country. 



As a committee, during our work, we
realised that the Students’ Representative
Councils (SRCs) who were present were
very happy With the issues that had been
brought before them and it clearly shows
that teachers or students who are going
to be enrolled in these institutions would
have a sigh of relief in the sense that the
institutions have been upgraded to that
of tertiary level. 



My only appeal is for Government to
continue funding teacher education in this
country and we should do that by even
increasing the allowances we give to the
trainees to enhance their studies in the
various institutions.



We all know that currently, if you look
at our public schools, the level in terms of
performance at the BECE is nothing to
write home about. We believe that if our
teachers are well motivated and
encouraged to study, to learn very hard
and then to pass out of these institutions,
it will go a long way to improve the
standard of teaching and learning in the
various schools. As a result, mother
Ghana will also benefit and our socio-
economic development will be enhanced.



My only appeal is for Government to
support the newly-established tertiary
institutions that are being put in place in
terms of the colleges of education by
providing the needed infrastructure, the
needed motivation that the trainee needs
to enhance teaching and learning in the
various - schools.



Thank you, Mr Speaker.

[802]

Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon
Minority Leader, will you be speaking’?
Will you contribute? This is because if
you will contribute, l want to hear from
you, then I will put the Question. This
Bill is not controversial. I have listened to
both sides; it is a straightforward –



Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
with respect, if you can grant some space
to the former Director-General of Ghana
Education Service. 



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Is it a formal
application? [Laughter]





Prof. Christopher Ameyaw-Akumfi
(NPP -- Techiman North): Thank you
Mr Speaker. 



Having contributed to the discussions
on the Bill, I can only recommend strongly
that we all support -it but I wish to make
two quick observations.



The first one is, the Committee‘s Report
rightly so, has not dropped a hint on
conditions of service strictly for the staff
who will now be in these tertiary
institutions. That is a huge challenge for
the Ministry of Education and I hope they
will start addressing it as quickly as
possible. This is because once we label
them as tertiary teachers, they become
automatically lecturers.



Like the polytechnics did, when there
was that transformation, we are likely
going to face that problem, so we should
begin to look at that and even look ahead
to the single spine arrangement and see
how we can quickly move them onto it.
Otherwise, agitations on the campuses will
begin with the declaration of these
institutions as tertiary institutions.



The second point is on chartering. The
Hon Deputy Minister for Education
should have helped us in this area This
is because when We came to affiliation, I

[803]

[PROF AMEYAW-AKUMFI]



Act that established the Accreditation
Board and the quote here by the Clerk is
from that document. The fact that
affiliation should be with the chartered
institution and the chartering is done by
Government, whether it is public or
private. 



So, these public institutions already
existing are all chartered institutions.
Where I have a slight objection is and
again, we can clarify this, is whether our
teacher education institutions, Cape
Coast and Winneba are chartered as such.
I am not quite clear on that but they are
chartered institutions and We insisted that
affiliations should be with chartered
institutions.



The additional adjectival clauses will
have to be checked but clearly, chartering
is not restricted to only private
institutions. I think once we clarity that,
this language could remain. We are still
insisting on getting the institutions
affiliated to chartered institutions.



With these harmless comments, I Wish
to lend my full support to this and l hope
the entire House will give its approval.



I thank you, Mr Speaker.



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Dr Appiah-
Kubi, I will give you two minutes, if you
feel strongly to contribute to this debate.
Two minutes. 



Dr Kojo Appiah-Kubi (NPP-AtWima-
Kwanwoma): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for
giving me the opportunity to associate
myself with the Motion on the floor of the
House.



A lot has been said about the
upgrading of teacher training colleges
into tertiary institutions. Particularly, this
upgrading will not only enhance the
productivity of the teacher training
colleges but also provide adequate and
appropriate teachers for our second cycle
institutions.



But while fulfilling this need, we
should also be as my other Colleague has
said, mindful of the fact that we are not
only raising the levels but we are also
meeting the expectations of the potential
trainees, expectations with regard to
conditions of service, expectations with
regard to salary levels.



We are all aware of the never ending
saga with the polytechnics, particularly
with the placement of potential graduands.
l think that we should start right now to
get the appropriate institutions to
consider these issues to avoid later, strike
actions and labour unrests on the
campuses as well as with labour.



Mr Speaker, with these few words, and
having given me two minutes, I would like
to support the Motion on the floor of the
House.



Thank you, very much.



Mr First Deputy Speaker; You did
very well, you operated within the two
minutes.



Hon Minority Leader, make your point,
then the Hon Deputy Minister will Wind
up, then I will put the Question.



12.35p.m.



Minority Leader (Mr Osei Kyei-
Mensah-Bonsu): Mr Speaker, thank you
for the opportunity to contribute to the
Motion.



Undoubtedly, Mr Speaker, improvement
in teacher education is pivotal to any
educational reform. So if government is
undertaking to upgrade teacher training
colleges to tertiary educational institutions,
certainly, it is worthy of support. In a lighter
vein, what I notice is that once this Bill is
passed and assented to by the President,
colleges in the system including Achimota
College, Prempeh College may become
extinct species.



So when they describe other
institutions, secondary schools that they

[805]

[MR KYEI-MENSAH-BONSU]



are the colleges in the system, from now
on, they will become extinct. However,
those of them bearing the name
"Academy" will be spared and that
includes your own alma mater. [Laughter]





Mr Speaker, as I was saying, the
intendment of this Bill is to provide
improvement in the quality of teaching. If
that happens, certainly, it will impact on
the education of pupils and students.
And because of the improvement in their
own abilities and competencies, it will urge
the teachers to remain in the classrooms
and so, the rate of retention of teachers in
the classrooms would appreciate
considerably. But certainly, once their
capacities are built, it comes necessarily
with upping their remunerations, certainly,
it will have an impact on our budget-



If we are talking about building
capacities and competence of teachers, I
believe necessarily, some restrictions will
be imposed on entry into these
institutions. That is something that we
should factor in.



That being the case, Mr Speaker, if we
are not careful, it will restrict the number
of students who would enter these
institutions. Yes, the professional
teachers, it is something that we should
consider- Already, the number in the
system, 3 8‘, is not encouraging enough and
if by elevating them to tertiary institutions,
we are going to further restrict entry into
those institutions, we may have to look at
it. Ultimately, we should work towards
increasing the numbers of such
institutions-



For now, we are looking for qualitative
improvement, which is good but we
should also aim at increasing the numbers
of such institutions; otherwise, as I have
said, if already we are going to restrict

[806]

entry into these institutions, 38, not as
many as we desire, it may consequentially
affect the number of teachers who may
come out. This is my worry. The principle
is understood but I think ultimately, we
should work to broaden the horizon, the
number of teachers to be employed;
otherwise, in the short to medium-term,
we should work to expand, the
infrastructure in these institutions to
accommodate many more applicants while
taking steps not to lower standards.



Mr Speaker, with these not too many
words, l would also want to lend my
support to the Motion.



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon Deputy
Minister, you may wind up.



Mr Mahama Ayariga: Mr Speaker, let
me thank the House and Hon Members
for the overwhelming support given to the
Motion. Mr Speaker, in doing so, let me
also just register and respond to a number
of issues and concerns raised by Hon
Members of the House.



Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Education
has already set in motion processes,
machineries and arrangements to ensure
a smooth transition from the teacher
training colleges to the colleges of
education. As teacher training colleges,
they used to _be under the ambit of the
Ghana Education Service and to manage
the transition. 



Mr Speaker, we have set up a transition
committee comprising of the -Ghana
Education Service and the National
Council for Tertiary Education (NCTE), so
that they can manage the transition from
Ghana Education Service (GES) managed
teacher training colleges to NCTE
supervised colleges of education that are
tertiary.



Mr Speaker, to be very frank with this
House, the governance structures have
also been set up though interim in nature.

[807]

[MR AYARIGA]

Therefore, the councils are in place, they
are learning how to operate as tertiary
institutions and we have also been
looking at the issue of infrastructure which
Hon Members of this House have raised.
We have, in fact, conducted an
infrastructure audit of all the colleges of
education to determine the infrastructural
upgrading needed in every college of
education to bring them to that level.



Lastly, Mr Speaker, we are also mindful
of the Minority Leader’s concern about
the possibility of opening it up,
opportunities of people entering the
colleges of education. But there is a
problem there, Mr Speaker. This is because
they are given allowances while they are
in school and also upon graduation, they
are automatically enrolled as professional
teachers and have to be paid.



We have to be careful about the
numbers and therefore, on an annual
basis, we admit about 9,000 into the 38
colleges of education and we graduate
about 8,700 from the various colleges of
education –



Mr First Deputy Speaker: I-ion Deputy
Minister, what are you being careful
about? Our population is growing. So you
either expand the infrastructure or you
give more to the colleges of education.
So unless We hold back some of these
factors that have influence, we have no
choice as a nation.



Mr Ayariga: Mr Speaker, I am not
saying that it is not our desire. It is the
desire of the Ministry of Education that
We admit more into the colleges of
education if this House will continue to
increase the allocations to the Ministry
of Education and GBS, so that we can
pay more teachers for the various basic
schools that We have in this country. I
was just addressing the concerns of the

[806]

Minority Leader and giving him the
statistics and the picture, so that we can
take it up from there.



Lastly Mr Speaker, there was a concern
about the tenure of the Principals of the
colleges of education -- [Interruption]

Dr A. A. Osei: On a point of order



Mr Speaker, my good Friend_has been
a Member of Parliament and he has been
Coming to Parliament these days. He said
Parliament would increase the budget of
the Ministry of Education. Mr Speaker,
the Constitution does not allow us to do
that. So he should increase it.



Mr Ayariga: Mr Speaker, I can tell that
he Will support and approve an increment
by Government of allocations to GES.



Lastly, Mr Speaker, the concerns raised
about - [Interruption]



Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
as I said, on yearly basis, the institutions
are recruiting about, as he said, 9,000. We
graduate about 8,700.‘ We are doing what
we are doing in a very ritualistic manner
and as you do know, in this year’s budget
alone, because what we are doing is just
repeating the steps that we have been
taking, we have to resort to 32,000 service
persons plus an addition of about 18,000
or so volunteers, which means they are
not professionals.



Mr Speaker, the quality of education
Will be going down if we continue to do
what we have been doing in a very regular
and ritualistic manner. That is why I am
saying that now that we may have to
restrict entry because of the upping of the
levels, how do we resolve this matter? The
principle is well founded and well
grounded. How do we expand in the short
to medium-term, so that we affect
positively the number in the class and
while also maintaining the quality that we
desire. That is the difficulty.

[809]

Mr. Ayariga: Mr Speaker, to conclude,
I would want to - [Interruption] --
You want me to respond to that?



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Hon Deputy
Minister, address the Chair.



Mr Ayariga: Mr Speaker, to conclude,
I would want to assure the Hon Minority
Leader and the House that steps are being
taken to improve on the quality of the
non-professional teachers. We now have
the untrained teachers programme where
we take all the non- professional teachers
and send them to the same Colleges of
Education and then take them through a
professional training programme and then
bring them back to the classrooms. So
there is work going on to addresse the
issues that he has raised.



On that note, Mr Speaker, let me thank
this House for the support that has been
given to this Bill. It will go a very long
way in improving upon the quality of
education at the basic level.



Thank you, Mr Speaker.



Mr First Deputy Speaker: Thank you
very much, Hon Deputy Minister.



Hon Members, that brings us to the
end of the debate on the Motion.



Question put and Motion agreed to.
