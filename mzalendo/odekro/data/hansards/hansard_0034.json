This is in accordance with articles 103 and 106 of the Constitution of Ghana and Standing Orders 125 and 181 of the House.\n The Committee was mandated to determine whether the Bill was of an urgent nature and could be taken under a certificate of urgency. The Committee after deliberating on the issue referred to Order l 19 and found it necessary to take the Bill under a certificate of urgency since the it has not fulfilled the requirement of a fourteen-day Gazette notification before being introduced to the House\n Moreover, Government intends to lay a number of Legislative Instruments to legalise the creation of some new districts and the elevation of some districts to Municipal Assemblies status.\n Government also considers that the time at its disposal for the above processes was rather short and therefore the Bill should be taken under a certificate of urgency.\n 2.0 Deliberations\n The Committee met with the Minister for Local Government and Rural Development the Deputy Minister, Hon. Aquinas T. Quansah and officials from the Ministry. The Committee appreciates their immense contributions and co-operation.\n 3.0 References In discussing the Bill, the Committee made reference to the following:",

If the amendment is not made, a number of municipalities created in 2004 and 2007 could be declared null and void.\n This is due to the fact that these municipalities which were created were not single \"compact settlements\"; and did not fulfill the strict legal requirements and therefore, rendered illegal.

Let us take Accra as an example. Accra has so many neighbourhoods that could easily be considered as a single compact settlement, eventually grouped together and made Accra as one single compact settlement.\n Another example is, Adabraka - I remember when I lived at Mc-Carthy Hill. From Mc-Carthy Hill to Mallam Junction, it was all bush; that was a few years ago. Lam talking about the seventies. I also remember \"Mile 7\" where we have the Pharmaceuticals. Between Achimota and Mile 7, it was all bush. So it would depend on who you are talking to. A forest could be part of a settlement; a river could be part of a settlement.

Why I am saying this is because, as the law stands now, there are single compact settlements which on their own have a population of more than 95,000 people.

There must be some clarity and we have been given guidance in the original law.\n Therefore, this amendment should seek to take into consideration the original intent plus other developments that we all recognise; such that we are saying that we should not simply look at the 95,000 as the yardstick but looking at the totality of a municipality made up of ~a single compact area plus other satellite areas that culturally, educationally or politically can constitute a municipality.\n Ithink this is avery important provision and we must be able to distinguish which is a municipality and which is a district. We must be able - otherwise, When we come to East Legon, I will demand a municipality. Is there any boundaries that guide the authorities who are supposed to propose municipalities or districts that they can use? What this law should not do is to make it an open-ended thing such that anywhere, _any place becomes a municipality. Then let us delete those clauses and let us decide - today, if we want to call Abokyiman a municipality, I would be very happy to propose that idea.\n But if we are Sitting here to make a law in relation to the Constitution, let us make it in such a way that there is guidance for the authorities to know Where a municipality can be created or where it cannot.\n I rest my case, Madam Speaker.",

If you look at the categories of people, you know that Judges normally listen to parties and take a decision.\n So we may have to look at a Judge of a Supreme Court [Interruption] No, We Will not bring Catholic Bishop there because he may disagree with the Jehovah Witness when it comes to some rituals.\n So I still think that we should look at ex-officio positions and then also look at people who in our reckoning, normally perform their duties with neutrality, something like that, for this particular Bill. Time is of essence; we must get them quickly to be there, so that when there is a dispute, they can come this side. So the three persons, l agree with the number, let us also now restrict the category to a certain group of people.\n As for the question of \"eminent persons\" I do not agree with that, because if I get elected as a President, I will decide who is eminent. I can go and take my village chief and say that he is eminent. So that is why I think we should narrow it by category.\n Mr Boafo - rose \u2013",
