Let us take Accra\r as an example. Accra has so many\r neighbourhoods that could easily be\r considered as a single compact settlement,\r eventually grouped together and made\r Accra as one single compact settlement.\n Another example is, Adabraka - I\r remember when I lived at Mc-Carthy Hill.\r From Mc-Carthy Hill to Mallam Junction,\r it was all bush; that was a few years ago.\r Lam talking about the seventies.

The truth is that, more and more, we\r are in a country that is becoming more\r cosmopolitan. Cosmopolitan, meaning\r that we have people coming from all over\r the world, all over the country with\r different kinds of cultures and attitudes\r and identity and all those who come to\r settle at a point and who want\r development.\n Now, supposing you have such a\r cosmopolitan area with 100,000 people\r without a nucleus cultural identity as he\r is talking about. Is he saying there\r cannot be a municipality?\n So Madam Speaker, I think that the\r heart of this amendment is about\r extending development to a people. It is\r about ensuring that when people are\r together and have reached a certain\r number, we can bring development to\r them. It is not about education, it is not\r about culture, it is not about any other\r identity he is talking about. We are talking\r about numbers and we are talking about\r geographical contiguity.\n So I think that the amendment can come\r as.Hon Haruna Iddrisu has said, when we\r come to Legislative Instruments, spelling\r out specific areas where we would Want a\r decision to be made but not in an Act\r which is talking of a general nature and\r specifying kinds of developments we\r want to see happen in our particular \u2013\n So, Madam Speaker, I would want to\r call on my Friends to support the Motion,\r so that we do not spend much more time\r on this debate.\n Some Hon Members --rose \u2013",

It is not standing on\r its own. And it can happen in a situation\r Where a person is appointed a Minister\r and changed to another Ministry within\r the same term. And so What this\r \"relevant\" is there to do, in my opinion, is\r to say that the handing-over notes must\r be relevant to the \"tenure of office\r immediately coterminous to the time that\r the person is handing over.
