One is the activities of market women in the rural areas.\n It may interest you to note that, these days, women find it very, very difficult to travel in the night because of the activities of these notorious armed robbers. These women carry a lot of money on them while visiting the marketing centers like Kumasi, Accra, Takoradi, et cetera. So, with the introduction of the e-Zwich, I think it would go a long way in assisting our rural women in going about their normal activities without fear or harm.\n Another area is students from rural areas who are in the cities and towns to continue their education. I think, with the e-Zwich, parents from rural areas will be able to send moneys or remittances to these students in a very easy and safe manner. So, I think it is a very good idea for the Government of Ghana to take this amount of money to continue making banking very, very effective in our rural areas.\n Come to places like Assemkro, Jima, Boisoo, Omapem in my constituency that do not have access to banking facilities. There is only one commercial bank which is sited at the center of the district capital so, with the introduction of the e-Zwich, I think it will help my people and all over this country to have access to good banking system.\n Thank you very much, for the opportunity.",

If one looks at the quantum of money for this one 7 million euros, it is something I believe could have been found within the banking sector in our country.

We are told that the focus of this project is the rural areas and the target group is the rural banking industry.\n The definition of a rural community by the project, is a community which is 4 kilometers away from a branch of a commercial bank or a community with an inhabitant of not more than 5,000.\n We think that this should be looked at. This is because if indeed, the rural banking industry is the target, then I must admit that most of these rural banks are located in areas with populations more than 4,000 and indeed, most of them too are in the peripheries of cities. So, if we go by this definition, most of them would be left out.\n Apart from that, we also have a problem with the interest rate at which the money would be on-lent to the institutions which will take this facility.~ This is because if",

Pursuant to article 106 of the Constitution and Standing Orders 125 and 178, Madam Speaker referred the Bill to the Committee on Health, for consideration and report.\n 2.0 Consideration of the Bill\n The Committee on Health as part of its mandate under article 106 (4) of the Constitution of Ghana and Standing Orders 125 and 178 published in the media requests for Written memoranda on the Bill. Subsequently, opportunity was provided for those who presented memoranda on the Bill to meet with the Committee for further deliberation on their proposals.\n The Committee further met for six (6) days with stakeholders from the health Sector to examine the Bill in detail.\n The Committee is grateful to the following for their inputs and support during the deliberations:\n 1 .

The 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana;\n 2. The Standing Orders of the Parliament of Ghana;\n 3. Memoranda from the public\n 4. The Medical Training and Research Bill.\n 4.0 Background\n Government has decided that laws in the health sector should be consolidated as appropriate into group legislation with common focus to reduce the number of laws relating to the sector. The Health Research and Training Bill therefore combines the laws for the Center for Plant Medicine Research, the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Ghana College of Nursing and Midwifery as well as the Ghana College of Pharmacists.",

The Center was mandated to conduct and promote scientific research which relates to the improvement of plant medicine.\n The law was enacted when the Food and Drugs Board was not in existence and was therefore given some regulatory functions which are now being performed by the Food and Drugs Board. This has led to duplication of functions.\n The current law does not also provide for a deputy director of the Center and the tenure of office of a director. It does not further differentiate between phyto- pharmaceutical and other pharmaceuticals, medicines and related substances.\n It is further necessary to change the name of the Center because it is often confused with the \"Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research\".\n Ghana over the years, experienced the exodus of doctors to other countries to either seek greener pastures or specialist training. The establishment of the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons seeks to curb this trend. The training of specialists locally will save the foreign exchange expended on foreign training.\n The availability of specialists locally may further attract foreign exchange to the country as non-Ghanaians in the sub- region seek specialist service in this country which is not available in their home countries.",

The provision would bring specialist training to the doorstep of the rural poor and to areas where doctors would otherwise not offer their services.",

It would also ensure that genuine pharmaceuticals are dispensed and the issue of fake drugs is brought to its barest minimum\n 7.0 Amendments\n The Committee after careful consideration of the Health Training and Research Bill recommends the following amendments:\n 1.

Thereafter, opportunity was provided for those who presented memoranda to meet with the Committee for further deliberation on their proposals.\n The Committee in January, 2011 commenced deliberation on the Bill but discussions stalled because of the provision in article 190 of the 1992 Constitution that promotes the establishment under the Public Services of Ghana, \"the Health Service\". The proposal for the establishment of another independent Mental Health Service, apart from the Ghana Health Service, was therefore an issue that needed further",

The MentalHealth Bill, 2010.\n 4.0 Background\n Ghana has had legislation on mental health since 1888, when the Lunatic Asylum Ordinance, Cap 79 became law to provide for custodial care for the mentally ill. The first asylum was thereafter built in 1906 to decongest the prison where arrested. mentally ill people were kept. The Ordinance remained in force with little modification until the Mental Health Act, 1972 (NRCD 30) was enacted.\n The Act was an improvement on the Ordinance and NRCD 30 which focused mainly on institutional care, the patient, the property of the patient and voluntary treatment. ln 1996, there was an attempt to revise the law but it was not feasible.\n This Bill has become necessary because the 1972 legislation is outmoded and is not in line with best practice in the management of mental health. New standards for mental health legislation, aim to protect, promote and improve the lives and well being of citizens with mental disorder. A legislation to acknowledge international instruments and obligations on human rights is therefore necessary to promote and protect the rights of people with mental disorder, as well as provide access to mental health care.\n This Bill adopts a human rights based approach in accordance with international agreements (WHO 2001, UN Charter) for the health care needs of a person with mental disorder. This would prevent discrimination and abuse and also offer equal opportunities to people with mental disorder.",

It is what composes of the \"Public Services of Ghana\" and that should not allow for any ambiguity in Parliament exercising its authority to create another institution to be known as the \"Mental Health Service. So, I think that the Committee got it wrong.\n We still can have a Mental Health service which will concentrate on the core objectives associated with this particular Bill. And I rather thought that the Committee should not mix matters of public service with Parliament exercising its mandate to create another institution even as it is allowed under article 190 (1) (d)\n \". . . such other public services as Parliament may by law prescribe\". Once we give approval to this Bill, Parliament has by law prescribed the establishment of a new institution to be known as the Mental Health Service.

This is because what has been captured in the Committee\u2019s Report, it is not correct, as far as the Constitution is concerned. It reads:\n \"However, article 190 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana provides for a \u2018National Health Service which presuppose that there cannot be another health service.\"\n That is where it is wrong. So, to that extent, I think that we can change. But fortunately, Mr Speaker, this is only a Committee\u2019s Report; it is not law. That is why we are in the process of transforming this Bill into law. So, we will I take note of that when it comes to the Consideration Stage. I hope that it is not a provision in the Bill anyway.\n I also want to allude to the earlier statement made by the Hon Deputy Ranking Member when we criticized the idea of our inability to supervise charismatic churches and other institutions outside the health institutions that deal with mental patients. I think that as a country, it is important for us to have a system that affects all other structures in the country. And if you look at the indignity that some of these patients go through in some of these spiritual churches, at cetera, I think it is important that we have a legal framework.",

But Mr Speaker, I thought that if we say \"the description\", I think it is more specific and more wider in scope than just saying the \"nature of the approved trade\". Yes, Hon Minister, that is Where I am coming from.\n The Hon Member for Akropong is drawing our attention that for purposes of consistency, we may have to amend this one, \"description\" and insert \"nature\" to be consistent with what we did earlier. But I am suggesting that, upon second thought, perhaps, we may have to look at it again. This is because \"description\" is more relevant and more specific in this case than just saying \"The nature of the approved trade\". What is the nature of the approved trade?\n So I think we should ponder over it a while to see which is a better terminology. I think \"description\" is a better terminology in this context than \"nature\" and I will suggest to them that if they should resort to the terminology \"nature\" they may need to add \"character\"; \"the nature and character of the approved trade\" and that will make it more verbose. So why not say the \"description\"?",
