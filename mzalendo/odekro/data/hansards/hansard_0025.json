After three years of operations, the need is felt to bring it to the rural areas.\n\nThe strategy of GhlPSS (known as the Rural Branch-less Banking Project) is to deploy, in partnership with financial institutions, the e-Zwich infrastructure in rural areas through networks of agents and merchants. The objective is to make formal financial services available to all persons resident in Ghana.\n\nAs the cost of investment for the e- Zwich infrastructure is high in comparison with expected revenues in rural areas, Government approached Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) to consider providing this facility which would operate as aRevo1ving Credit Fund (RCF) to financial institutions interested in deploying e-Zwich infrastructure in rural areas through networks of agents and merchants.\n\nThe 7.0 million euros loan would therefore be used to finance the RCF facility which promises to be a strong incentive to support the deployment of e- Zwich in rural areas.\n\n3.0 Purpose of the credit\n\nThe purpose of the Credit is to procure funds to establish RCF from which loans would be provided to financial institutions",

To this, it was explained to the Committee that, loans from the RCF to the financial institutions would be cedi denominated, therefore the interest rate would be pegged at 6 per cent, a rate far lower than the BOG prime rate, to enable as many financial institutions as possible to take advantage of the facility to bring the e-Zwich services to rural dwellers.\nThe Committee noted that the project would contribute to the development of the financial system and improve the economic circumstance of people living in rural areas.\nThe Chief Executive Officer of GhlPSS projected to the Committee that seven million people are expected to be using the e-Zwich by the year 2015; about seven million of whom would be in rural areas.

They further suggested that the e-Zwich be used to pay pensioners, student loan beneficiaries, national service persons, National Youth Employment Programme beneficiaries and other like groups for enhanced convenience and to help reduce banking charges.\n The Committee observed that the e- Zwich facility would help rural dwellers, especially, traders to avoid travelling with large sums of cash and the attendant robbery attacks.\n Some Hon Members of the Committee expressed the opinion that the loan, amounting to 7.0 million euros, should have rather been sourced from the local financial market rather than from the KfW, a foreign entity. Deputy Minister Finance and Economic Planning, Hon Seth Terkpeh however, explained that even though borrowing from the local market was desirable, most of the local banks were unwilling to lend funds beyond five years and additionally were unable to lend to Government on concessionary terms.\n Anti-Corruption\n Pursuant to article 8.1 of the Loan Agreement, the Government of Ghana (Borrower) is required to\n \"ensure that the persons charged by the same with the preparation and implementation of the project, the award of any contract for the\n\nsupplies and services to be financed and with requesting disbursements of loan amounts do not demand, assume, render, grant, promise or obtain a promise of unlawful payments or other advantages in connection with these tasks.\"\n\n6.0 Taxes and Public Charges\n\nArticle 5 (1) of the Loan Agreement stipulates that\n\n\"the Borrower shall make all payments to be effected under this Agreement Without any deduction for taxes, other public charges, or other costs, and shall pay the transfer and conversion costs . accruing in connection with the disbursement of the loan.\"\n\nAgain, the Government of Ghana (Borrower) is required to\n\nbear all taxes and other public charges accruing outside the - Federal Republic of Germany in connection with the conclusion and execution of this Agreement\" (article\n\n52).\n\nThe Committee entreated the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning to endeavor to bring a formal request to Parliament for the waiver of the relevant taxes and duties associated with the project for consideration and approval.\n\n7.0 Conclusion\n\nIn view of the foregoing observations, the Committee recommends to the House to adopt this Report and approve by Resolution, the Loan Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Ghana and Kredistanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) Frankfurt AM Main, Germany for an amount of seven million euros (7,000,000.00 euros) for the implementation of the e-Zwich Rural Branch-less Banking in accordance with article 181 of the Constitution, sections 3 and 7 of the Loans Act, 1970 (Act 33 5) and the Standing Orders of the House.\n\nRespectfully submitted.",

This would encourage more and more banks to come in and indeed, if Government is taking the facility for 40 years and then adding the grace period of 10 years to it, it means that the facility is going to be in Ghana for 50 years. But then, the banks are taking it for four years. Which means that the repayment period too for the banks, would be too short; so at least, if it can be extended.\nMr Speaker, I am convinced that the 6 per cent interest rate is high, especially now that we are even claiming that our cedi is stable against the Dollar. So, if the cedi is stable, Why are we then saying that a Cedi denominated facility should attract a higher interest rate.

However, I would want to point out one or two observations that we made at the committee meeting.\n Just before recess, I was privileged to be in the team of Members of Parliament that went for a West Africa Monitory Zone meeting in Guinea, Conakry, to be precise.\n Mr Speaker, if there Was one thing that Ghana was praised for implementing, then it is this particular project that Ghana has implemented since 2008. We are told that the focus of this project is the rural areas and the target group is the rural banking industry.\n The definition of a rural community by the project, is a community which is 4 kilometers away from a branch of a commercial bank or a community with an inhabitant of not more than 5,000.\n We think that this should be looked at. This is because if indeed, the rural banking industry is the target, then I must admit that most of these rural banks are located in areas with populations more than 4,000 and indeed, most of them too are in the peripheries of cities. So, if we go by this definition, most of them would be left out.\n Apart from that, we also have a problem with the interest rate at which the money would be on-lent to the institutions which will take this facility.- This is because if\n\nGovernment is going for the facility at 0.75 per cent, for 40 years, then some of us think that, giving it to the banks and institutions at 6 per cent is on the higher side.

One is the activities of market women in the rural areas.\n It may interest you to note that, these days, women find it very, very difficult to travel in the night because of the activities of these notorious armed robbers. These women carry a lot of money on them while visiting the marketing centers like Kumasi, Accra, Takoradi, et cetera. So, with the introduction of the e-Zwich, I think it would go a long way in assisting our rural women in going about their normal activities without fear or harm.\n Another area is students from rural areas who are in the cities and towns to continue their education. I think, with the e-Zwich, parents from rural areas will be able to send moneys or remittances to these students in a very easy and safe manner. So, I think it is a very good idea for the Government of Ghana to take this amount of money to continue making banking very, very effective in our rural areas.\n Come to places like Assemkro, Jima, Boisoo, Omapem in my constituency that do not have access to banking facilities. There is only one commercial bank which is sited at the center of the district capital so, with the introduction of the e-Zwich, I think it will help my people and all over this country to have access to good banking system.\n Thank you very much, for the opportunity.",

There are many other things that we ought to do in order to attain that particular goal which all of us strive for.\n But Mr Speaker, I would have wanted to see the effects of the e-Zwich system in the areas where it has been applied over the last few years and I believe that the e- Zwich probably has not been as successful as was\" initially planned. However, the objective of banking the un-banked, especially in the rural areas is something I believe all of us can support.\n But I get worried, Mr Speaker that; it appears we are getting ourselves caught in a loan strap where everything that we need in this country, we have to borrow money from somewhere. If one looks at the quantum of money for this one 7 million euros, it is something I believe could have been found within the banking sector in our country. After all, this is to support the financial sector of our country and then link it up with the rural areas of our country.\n I think 7 million euros we could probably have found it .within our country. So my worry is that, let us not get into a loan strap because that will also lead us into a debt trap.\n I thank you, Mr Speaker.",

Mr Speaker, that is a very good statement because most of our people coming from the rural areas and less educated are not happy going to banks to secure money, hence some of them are tempted to keep the money under their pillows. Any facility that would come to their aid in the rural area, for them to access easily, Mr Speaker, is something that all of us must support.\n Again, Mr Speaker, it is said that this will also enable people not to carry large sums of money on them, thereby falling prey to armed robbers as they travel along.

It will again assist in reducing the patient to doctor ratio to an appreciable level.\nThere has never been a postgraduate College of Nursing and Midwifery in the country. This therefore resulted in the mass exodus of nurses from the country. The establishment of the Ghana College of Nursing and Midwifery will promote specialist education in nursing and midwifery.\nThe College will also conduct and organize specialist examinations in nursing, midwifery and related disciplines. This will ensure the production of adequate nurses to serve in the regions and districts as well as ensure effective and efficient care of patients in our hospitals.\nThe Ghana College of Pharmacists will promote specialist education in pharmacy by organizing and supervising specialist training in pharmacy and related disciplines. Graduates from the schools will assist our hospitals as well as industries in the purchasing, dispensing and manufacture of drugs.\n5.0 Object of the Bill\nThe object of this Bill is to establish four postgraduate colleges.

The Center was mandated to conduct and promote scientific research which relates to the improvement of plant medicine.\n The law was enacted when the Food and Drugs Board was not in existence and was therefore given some regulatory functions which are now being performed by the Food and Drugs Board. This has led to duplication of functions.\n The current law does not also provide for a deputy director of the Center and the tenure of office of a director. It does not further differentiate between phyto- pharmaceutical and other pharmaceuticals, medicines and related substances.\n It is further necessary to change the name of the Center because it is often confused with the \"Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research\".\n Ghana over the years, experienced the exodus of doctors to other countries to either seek greener pastures or specialist training. The establishment of the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons seeks to curb this trend. The training of specialists locally will save the foreign exchange expended on foreign training.\n The availability of specialists locally may further attract foreign exchange to the country as non-Ghanaians in the sub- region seek specialist service in this country which is not available in their home countries.\n\nThe Bill provides a legal framework for running of the College. The College will also develop and oversee structured post- graduate training programmes in various medical and surgical specialists. This will lead to the production of specialists to serve in the regions and districts, thereby making medicine and surgery readily available and accessible to ordinary citizens. It will again assist in reducing the patient to doctor ratio to an appreciable level.\n\nThere has never been a postgraduate College of Nursing and Midwifery in the country. This therefore resulted in the mass exodus of nurses from the country. The establishment of the Ghana College of Nursing and Midwifery will promote specialist education in nursing and midwifery.\n\nThe College will also conduct and organize specialist examinations in nursing, midwifery and related disciplines. This will ensure the production of adequate nurses to serve in the regions and districts as well as ensure effective and efficient care of patients in our hospitals.\n\nThe Ghana College of Pharmacists will promote specialist education in pharmacy by organizing and supervising specialist training in pharmacy and related disciplines. Graduates from the schools will assist our hospitals as well as industries in the purchasing, dispensing and manufacture of drugs.\n\n5.0 Object of the Bill\n\nThe object of this Bill is to establish four postgraduate colleges.

The provision would bring specialist training to the doorstep of the rural poor and to areas where doctors would otherwise not offer their services.\n\nThe training of specialists locally will also save the foreign exchange expended on Ghanaians who seek foreign training abroad.

Pursuant to article 106 of the Constitution and Standing Orders 125 and 178, Madam Speaker, Justice Mrs. Joyce Bamford- Addo referred the Bill to the Committee on Health for consideration and report.\n 2.0 Consideration of the Bill\n As part of its mandate under article 106 (4) of the Constitution of Ghana and Standing Orders 125 and 178, the Committee on Health published in the media requests for written memoranda on the Bill. Thereafter, opportunity was provided for those who presented memoranda to meet with the Committee for further deliberation on their proposals.\n The Committee in January, 2011 commenced deliberation on the Bill but discussions stalled because of the provision in article 190 of the 1992 Constitution that promotes the establishment under the Public Services of Ghana, \"the Health Service\". The proposal for the establishment of another independent Mental Health Service, apart from the Ghana Health Service, was therefore an issue that needed further\n\nconsideration.

This covers charismatic churches that specialize in -healing mental disorders as well as traditional healers. It ensures that standards, conditions and rights are relevant to all facilities in order to avoid the abuse of people with mental disorder.\nThe Ministry of Health\u2019s policy is now to shift the focus of mental health treatment from institutionalized care to the integration of mental health with general health care at the community level. The Ministry also advocates multi-sectorial liaison with the education, social welfare, criminal justice and non-governmental systems.\n5.0 Object of the Bill\nThe object of this Bill is to promote access to basic mental health care in the least restrictive environment which is one of the basic mental health care principles. It is also to encourage early identification and prompt treatment of mental disorder in primary care at the district, regional and general hospitals.\n6.0 Highlights of the contents of the Bill\nThe Bill contains a total of ninety-four (94) clauses. These clauses are in nine groups.\nClauses 1 to 10 of the Bill provide for the establishment, objectives and functions of the Mental Health Service as well as its governing body.\nClauses 11 to 23 deal with the establishment of mental health services at the regional and district level and states the conduct and regulations of the business of the Authority.\nClauses 24 to 33 make provision for a quasi-judicial Mental Health Tribunal.\nClauses 34 to 38 of the Bill state the provisions relating to visiting committees.\nClauses 39 to 41 recognition voluntary treatment thereby replicating provisions_ in the NRCD 30.\nClauses 42 to 53 deal with involuntary treatment to promote community- based care and rehabilitation.\nClauses 54 to 63 define the rights of persons with mental disorders.\nClauses 64 to 79 address issues relating to the protection of vulnerable groups such as females, children, the aged and mentally retarded.\nClauses 80 to 93 provide for miscellaneous matters.\n7.0 Observations and recommendations\n7.1 Establishment of a service\nThe Committee noted that the Bill proposes the establishment of a Mental Health Service. However, article 190 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana provides for a \"National Health Service\" which presupposes that there cannot be another health service. The establishment of a Mental Health Service would therefore contravene the law. It may also bring to bear, a new charge to the Consolidated Fund.\nTo align the Bill to the requirement of the Constitution, the Committee recommends the establishment of an \"Authority\" under the Ministry of Health with its own Board. The Authority would\nhave the ability to seek funds from other sources to ensure that mental health receives the requisite attention and support it deserves.\n7.2 Structure of the Authority\nThe Committee also realized that the Bill creates structures parallel to that of the Ghana Health Service. The Committee, however, recommends an integrated form of administration where the structures of the Mental Health Authority would be part of the structure of the Ghana Health Service. It is for instance recommended that the Regional and District Mental Health Directors be part of the Regional and District Health Management Teams. They would also be appointed by the Board in consultation with the Regional Health Management Team.\n7.3 Extension of mental health care\nThe Bill further advocates the extension of mental health care to include private mental health care, charismatic churches that specialize in healing mental disorders as well as traditional healers. The Committee lauded the decision to include all these institutions because of their propensity to abuse mental health patients. It would also ensure that standards of mental health care are sustained and the human rights of mental health patients are protected.\nThe Committee recommends that the Mental Health Authority when established should ensure that all private mental health care providers bring their facilities to the required standard.\n7.4 Creation of a mental health fund\nThe Committee proposes the creation of a fund in line with what was provided for in the Anti-Drug Trafficking Act.

The MentalHealth Bill, 2010.\n 4.0 Background\n Ghana has had legislation on mental health since 1888, when the Lunatic Asylum Ordinance, Cap 79 became law to provide for custodial care for the mentally ill. The first asylum was thereafter built in 1906 to decongest the prison where arrested. mentally ill people were kept. The Ordinance remained in force with little modification until the Mental Health Act, 1972 (NRCD 30) was enacted.\n The Act was an improvement on the Ordinance and NRCD 30 which focused mainly on institutional care, the patient, the property of the patient and voluntary treatment. ln 1996, there was an attempt to revise the law but it was not feasible.\n This Bill has become necessary because the 1972 legislation is outmoded and is not in line with best practice in the management of mental health. New standards for mental health legislation, aim to protect, promote and improve the lives and well being of citizens with mental disorder. A legislation to acknowledge international instruments and obligations on human rights is therefore necessary to promote and protect the rights of people with mental disorder, as well as provide access to mental health care.\n This Bill adopts a human rights based approach in accordance with international agreements (WHO 2001, UN Charter) for the health care needs of a person with mental disorder. This would prevent discrimination and abuse and also offer equal opportunities to people with mental disorder.\n\nThe Bill further applies to both the private and the public sector.

It is also to encourage early identification and prompt treatment of mental disorder in primary care at the district, regional and general hospitals.\n\n6.0 Highlights of the contents of the Bill\n\nThe Bill contains a total of ninety-four (94) clauses. These clauses are in nine groups.\n\nClauses 1 to 10 of the Bill provide for the establishment, objectives and functions of the Mental Health Service as well as its governing body.\n\nClauses 11 to 23 deal with the establishment of mental health services at the regional and district level and states the conduct and regulations of the business of the Authority.\n\nClauses 24 to 33 make provision for a quasi-judicial Mental Health Tribunal.\n\nClauses 34 to 38 of the Bill state the provisions relating to visiting committees.\n\nClauses 39 to 41 recognition voluntary treatment thereby replicating provisions_ in the NRCD 30.\n\nClauses 42 to 53 deal with involuntary treatment to promote community- based care and rehabilitation.\n\nClauses 54 to 63 define the rights of persons with mental disorders.\n\nClauses 64 to 79 address issues relating to the protection of vulnerable groups such as females, children, the aged and mentally retarded.\n\nClauses 80 to 93 provide for miscellaneous matters.\n\n7.0 Observations and recommendations\n\n7.1 Establishment of a service\n\nThe Committee noted that the Bill proposes the establishment of a Mental Health Service. However, article 190 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana provides for a \"National Health Service\" which presupposes that there cannot be another health service. The establishment of a Mental Health Service would therefore contravene the law. It may also bring to bear, a new charge to the Consolidated Fund.\n\nTo align the Bill to the requirement of the Constitution, the Committee recommends the establishment of an \"Authority\" under the Ministry of Health with its own Board. The Authority would\n\nhave the ability to seek funds from other sources to ensure that mental health receives the requisite attention and support it deserves.\n\n7.2 Structure of the Authority\n\nThe Committee also realized that the Bill creates structures parallel to that of the Ghana Health Service. The Committee, however, recommends an integrated form of administration where the structures of the Mental Health Authority would be part of the structure of the Ghana Health Service. It is for instance recommended that the Regional and District Mental Health Directors be part of the Regional and District Health Management Teams. They would also be appointed by the Board in consultation with the Regional Health Management Team.\n\n7.3 Extension of mental health care\n\nThe Bill further advocates the extension of mental health care to include private mental health care, charismatic churches that specialize in healing mental disorders as well as traditional healers. The Committee lauded the decision to include all these institutions because of their propensity to abuse mental health patients. It would also ensure that standards of mental health care are sustained and the human rights of mental health patients are protected.\n\nThe Committee recommends that the Mental Health Authority when established should ensure that all private mental health care providers bring their facilities to the required standard.\n\n7.4 Creation of a mental health fund\n\nThe Committee proposes the creation of a fund in line with what was provided for in the Anti-Drug Trafficking Act.

It is what composes of the \"Public Services of Ghana\" and that should not allow for any ambiguity in Parliament exercising its authority to create another institution to be known as the \"Mental Health Service. So, I think that the Committee got it wrong.\n We still can have a Mental Health service which will concentrate on the core objectives associated with this particular Bill.
