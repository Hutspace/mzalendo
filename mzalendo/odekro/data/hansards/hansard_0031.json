If we go into those experts\u2019 recommendations, we will find answers to improve the quality of education generally and particularly teachers.

What were the criteria that were put down by the affiliated institutions that were guiding them? If they were going strictly by them, why will this thing happen to confuse a lot of students, their parents and the country as a whole? Huge fees and the like - I spoke on one of the radio stations and proposed that if they had agreed to refund their moneys to them, it should not be just the moneys they have given to them.\n They should charge them on the prevailing interest rate\u2018 and then they should also consider the emotional trauma, other problems that they might have associated with --- the embarrassment --- and pay whatever they are to them.

We believe that if our teachers are well motivated and encouraged to study, to learn very hard and then to pass out of these institutions, it will go a long way to improve the standard of teaching and learning in the various schools. As a result, mother Ghana will also benefit and our socio- economic development will be enhanced.\n My only appeal is for Government to support the newly-established tertiary institutions that are being put in place in terms of the colleges of education by providing the needed infrastructure, the needed motivation that the trainee needs to enhance teaching and learning in the various - schools.\n Thank you, Mr Speaker.",

That is a huge challenge for the Ministry of Education and I hope they will start addressing it as quickly as possible. This is because once we label them as tertiary teachers, they become automatically lecturers.\n Like the polytechnics did, when there was that transformation, we are likely going to face that problem, so we should begin to look at that and even look ahead to the single spine arrangement and see how we can quickly move them onto it. Otherwise, agitations on the campuses will begin with the declaration of these institutions as tertiary institutions.\n The second point is on chartering.

I am not quite clear on that but they are chartered institutions and We insisted that affiliations should be with chartered institutions.\n The additional adjectival clauses will have to be checked but clearly, chartering is not restricted to only private institutions.
