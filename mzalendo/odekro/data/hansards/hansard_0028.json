I trust Honourable Members will, as usual, continue to give the Chair and Leadership, the needed cooperation and improve upon their attendance to the House to enable us complete our business on time.\n Honourable Members, once again, I welcome you back to the House and wish you an enjoyable and fruitful working Meeting.\n Thank you.
