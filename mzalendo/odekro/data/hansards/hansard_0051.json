That is a private sector intervention; it is a private sector that is trying to do that and will earn its money through the sale of the water. But this one is Government responsibility.\n So, they are different sources. In fact, the water in the Volta River could water the whole of this country. It is sufficient to water the whole of this country and so, at any time, we can draw it from either the Red, Black or White Volta, or upstream or downstream. In fact, what is happening is a siltation of the water course but as now, we, together with Volta River Authority (VRA) are putting in place a dredging of the river course and there is a company now at the downstream level doing some dredging works.\n So that will maintain or even improve upon the capacity of the Volta River to hold on to more water for use by this country for drinking, agriculture and fishing. That is being worked on; they are different projects.",

Then after that, when it comes to maybe, the \"Purchase\" because they have followed the guidelines to the letter, approval will then be given by the PURC.\n Also importantly, because we want to deregulate the energy sector, we should not be putting so much into the hands of the PURC such that if it decides that, \"no, this is not what I want\", no company will be able to go into that area. So we have to identify what role we Want the PURC to play and that role is what the original clause is proposing to us.

If you look at the Bill, we were talking about creating a Fund, getting the PURC to balance all sources of energy to try to get the businessmen who are coming to generate the renewable sources, that this will make business sense, come and invest in renewable sources.\n So the PURC's role is very important. One; in terms of being part of the PPA negotiation -- in terms of providing \"guidelines\" they are being part. But also importantly, to make sure that they help set the tariff for the amount that is really being agreed on by the distribution company and the provider of that kind of renewable sources of energy.
