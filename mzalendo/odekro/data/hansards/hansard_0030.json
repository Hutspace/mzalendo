The Lord has answered our prayers for an eventful but peaceful recess and once more brought us back to complete work for the last lap of our four- year mandate. I believe you all had a good and restful holiday.\n This Meeting and subsequent ones within our tenure will be bu.sy and demanding of us. A lot of work will be referred to the House for consideration. Being a political campaign period for the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections, the usual fervour for clamouring for public attention by your respective political parties will undoubtedly be high. As the political barometer of the country will be naturally charged, let us all be circumspect in our discourses as opinion leaders and Members of Parliament.\n Already, there are simmering indications of this thick, politically charged cloud moving round us but at least, thankfully, not in the House. Let us at least, bury the political hatchet once we are in the House, since our overriding concern, as I always say, is the national interest.\n We must be the forerunners preaching the peace and the need for the consolidation of the democratic culture and all that it entails to the people of Ghana. Importantly, we must, as usual, disagree if need be but co-operate to carry out the business of the House at all times.\n I hope my Leaders in particular have already taken very good note of my appeal. They must do well to carry all along as a body with a common purpose.\n The maturity and professional competence of the Clerk and his staff and indeed, the Press Corps here will be needed throughout this period of intense political activity. I fervently pray that the good Lord will give us strength and candour to start and conclude the Meeting to His Glory and to the admiration of all Ghanaians.",

Then the intestate Succession Bill would also be looked at, and then the College of Education Bill, 2011 would also be considered.\n It is anticipated. that we would look at these three Bills, just before the State of the Nation Address sometime in the middle of February.\n So I would want to urge committee Chairpersons and Ranking Members to take note and try to co-operate with the Business Committee, so that we can\n\nexpedite action on these Bills.
