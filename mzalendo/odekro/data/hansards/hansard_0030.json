The Lord has\r answered our prayers for an eventful but\r peaceful recess and once more brought\r us back to complete work for the last lap\r of our four- year mandate. I believe you\r all had a good and restful holiday.\n This Meeting and subsequent ones\r within our tenure will be bu.sy and\r demanding of us. A lot of work will be\r referred to the House for consideration.\r Being a political campaign period for the\r Presidential and Parliamentary Elections,\r the usual fervour for clamouring for public\r attention by your respective political\r parties will undoubtedly be high. As the\r political barometer of the country will be\r naturally charged, let us all be circumspect\r in our discourses as opinion leaders and\r Members of Parliament.\n Already, there are simmering\r indications of this thick, politically\r charged cloud moving round us but at\r least, thankfully, not in the House. Let us\r at least, bury the political hatchet once\r we are in the House, since our overriding\r concern, as I always say, is the national\r interest.\n We must be the forerunners preaching\r the peace and the need for the\r consolidation of the democratic culture\r and all that it entails to the people of\r Ghana. Importantly, we must, as usual,\r disagree if need be but co-operate to carry\r out the business of the House at all times.\n I hope my Leaders in particular have\r already taken very good note of my\r appeal. They must do well to carry all along\r as a body with a common purpose.\n The maturity and professional\r competence of the Clerk and his staff and\r indeed, the Press Corps here will be\r needed throughout this period of intense\r political activity. I fervently pray that the\r good Lord will give us strength and\r candour to start and conclude the\r Meeting to His Glory and to the admiration\r of all Ghanaians.",
