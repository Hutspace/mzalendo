Odekro is working with a number of partners to create this platform:

## mySociety

mySociety is the project of UK Citizens Online Democracy, a UK registered charity. mySociety runs most of the best-known democracy and transparency websites in the UK, sites like TheyWorkForYou and WriteToThem.

mySociety has two missions. The first is to be a charitable project which builds websites that give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. The second is to teach the public and voluntary sectors, through demonstration, how to use the internet most efficiently to improve lives.

## BloggingGhana

BloggingGhana (BloGh) is a group of bloggers and social media users writing out of Ghana or the Ghanaian experience. It is also an aggregator website that collects the latest posts and tweets from our members. Since June 2011 we are a registered non-profit organization with a executive council working towards the following objectives
 
Serving as a forum for bloggers in Ghana to network and exchange ideas

* Building capacity among bloggers in Ghana
* Accessing new audiences for our blogs through a mutual website (aggregator) and other activities
* Promoting citizen journalism in Ghana
* Educating the general public in Ghana on the opportunities of social media

The idea of starting BloGh came out of a meet-up of bloggers on 24 July 2008.  To that first meeting, organized by bloggers Sandra Crabbe and Kajsa Hallberg Adu, eight bloggers were invited.Since the inception of BloGh many friendships, projects and business ventures have emerged from the group or with help from this network that spans sectors, professions and social groups. Currently, BloGh organizes BlogCampâ€™s and a social-media drive for the Ghanaian 2012 general elections, under the name of #GhanaDecides.
