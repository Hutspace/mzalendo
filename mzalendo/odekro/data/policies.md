## Amendment Policy
1. If you believe that any information on Odekro.org is inaccurate please contact us using the 'Correct This Information' option on the appropriate page. Please tell us more than a simple 'this information is wrong'. Please provide us with a source either for more accurate information or for proof that the information currently included is incorrect.

## Take-Down Policy
1. Registered users of the site have the ability to post comments on almost every page on Odekro.org
1. Once posted, the comment can be seen by the user and shared with others, but it will not be published on the site until a moderator approves it.
1. Once a moderator has approved a comment, it will be published on the site
1. If a user has demonstrated that they are a trust-worthy commenter, their comments will be auto-approved without intervention from a moderator.
1. If you believe a comment (or other piece of information) on the site is offensive or inappropriate in any way please report it.
1. Comments can be reported using the 'Report It' button, other pieces of information can be reported using the 'Correct This Information' button.
1. If a piece of information has been flagged as being offensive or inappropriate, an Odekro moderator will prevent the comment from being publicly viewed whilst it is reviewed.
1. If, after the review the Odekro team deems that the information is inappropriate, it will continue to be blocked from public access. If it is deemed to be appropriate, then it will be made accessible for public viewing again.
