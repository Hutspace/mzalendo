(Mr Emmanuel K. Bandua: Some statements --
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Chairman, Some statements spanning a 
few lines. --

Mr Bandua: All right

Clause 6 -- Handing over Notes.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, a statment. 

Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
a statment.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So, a question? 
a statement.

Clause 7 -Availability of the handing
over notes

Mr Kwabena Okyere Darko-Mensah:
Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Bandua: I think I support the
amendment- That will conform with
paragraph (b), subparagraphs (ii) and (iv).

Mr Ghartey: Mr Speaker, a sentence. Mr. Speaker, a sentence.

11.20am

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon Joe
Ghartey, after that rare submission, what
do you suggest?

Mr Ghartey: Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Darko~Mensah: Mr Speaker, a sentence."-

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So that
would come in, anyway.

But what about reference to the Council
of State? 

Mr Darko-Mensahz: Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker, a sentence. Another
sentence. Yet another sentence.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Then we
still have for clause 7 (ii), delete
"Speaker", substitute "Parliament",

Mr William O. Boafo: Mr Speaker, a sentence. 
Yet more sentences. And yet another.
And another sentence.

A new paragraph. Some more sentences

Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: A sentence that 
spans multiple lines.
Last sentence.

11.30 a.m. 

Mr Joseph B. Aidoo: Mr. Speaker, a sentence. -

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Very
well. 

In line with the position taken by the
Hon Majority Leader and Hon Boafo -

Mr J. B. Aidoo: Exactly so. A sentence that 
spans multiple lines -

Mr Darko-Mensah: Mr Speaker, a sentence. 
Another sentence.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker:Thank
you very much.

Yes, Chairman of the Committee, final
word. 
Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Another sentence that spans multiple 
lines.

Another paragraph, Mr Speaker.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I will put
the Question.
Alhaji Pelpuo -rose-

Mr. Second Deputy Speaker: I think we
have had quite an exhaustive debate on
this matter

Hon Deputy Majority Leader, I
recognize you.

Alhaji Pelpuo: Mr Speaker, a sentence. 
So we have to understand the distinction
between the two before we vote on it.

Dr Anthony A. Osei - rose -

Mr Second Deputy Speaker:Thank
you very much. I will put the Question.

Hon Dr Osei, I recognize you from the
other side as the last word -

Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, a sentence. 

So if we want to be consistent, then we
must accept the amendment. It is only
consistent with what it is here. Otherwise,
it should be the Chairman of the Council
of State and whoever heads the National
Archives for consistency.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Very
well "

Question put and amendment agreed
to.

Mr Avoka -rose-
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, do you want to take a
step further to my ruling? Then we would
proceed, I do not mind. 

Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, a sentence. The AYES had it; the
amendment is carried.

Clause 7, further amendment standing
in the name of Hon Darko-Mensah --

Mr Darko-Mensah: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
This is to conform with what we have
already. 

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, it is virtually consequential, I
will put the Question.

Alhaji Pelpuo: Mr Speaker, a sentence. So we step
this matter down until we have more
exhaustive discussion on it.

11.40 am.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Deputy Majority Leader, you will agree
with me that if it is a matter of exhaustive
debate, we really have had it and so much,
so that when got up, when I said I was
going to put the Question, I nevertheless
allowed - and any other Hon Member who
had not contributed was given a further
chance.

So let us call for a headcount and close
the matter. '

Hon Majority Leader, do you want to -

Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Speaker on the voice vote is
challenged." 

To the best of my knowledge, no Hon
Member has called for it yet.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: This is
because I have not determined the matter.
I have not pronounced on "Ayes" having
one or "Noes" having one and the rules
allow me before I make a pronouncement,
to proceed the way I am proceeding, very
much in line with the rules.

Question put and the House counted:

AYES - 38
NOBS - 41
ABSTENTIONS -

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
amendment is lost.

I will put the Question on the entire
clause -

Mr Dery: Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: As of
now, we do not know those who
abstained- Let us make progress.

Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Mr Speaker,
clause 7, we have the National Archives.
That is not the designation; it is Public
Records and Archives Administration. So
if that could be corrected.

Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Question put and amendment agreed
to.

Clause 7 as amended ordered to stand
part of the Bill.

Clause 8 --- Presidential Estates Unit

Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker, a sentence. -

Mr Speaker, a sentence. That is the rationale for this
amendment. ’We want to separate the two.

11.50 am.

Alhaji H. Iddrisu: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Once there is an Act which governs
and supports the procurement process in
this country, we need not make specific
reference to it.

Mr Bandua: I do not think you have
listened to my amendment -

Mr Second" Deputy Speaker: Hon
Chairman of the Committee, you may make
your point, addressing -

Mr Bandua: I do not see the relevance
of the point he is raising. If it goes on --
first, we have tried to separate it -so the
Procurement Act does not come here at
all.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I think
the Hon Minister‘s point is, do you need
to mention, "in accordance with Public
Procurement Act" -

Mr Bandua: When an Act applies
rightly in a situation, I think there is
nothing right mentioning -

Mr J. B. Aidoo: Mr Speaker, a sentence. This is
because the essence of the amendment
as has been proposed by the Committee
is to remove that phrase starting from:
"procure in accordance with the Public
Procurement Act. . ." So that the rendition
will read.

So in this case, "Public Procurement"
-, and all those aspects do not come in
at all. 

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So that--

Prof. Gyan-Baffour: l think the
Chairman made it very clear that he is
trying to do that to, take away.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Where
"procure" means purchasing or Where
"procure" means obtaining. I would want
us to address our minds to it.--

Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Colleagues, the last Hon Member has
indicated, the provision of the Public
Procurement Act, 2003 in this Bill is
misplaced. This is a transition team. No.

They are supposed to take inventory
of the items, so that when the President
takes over, then he has a list of items he is
inheriting. When he is leaving office--

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, the amendment is
intended to do what-

Order! Order!

Mr Avoka: We are to delete from (a) to
"procure in accordance with the Public
Procurement Act, 2003, (Act 663)." We
delete all that and then we insert "to take",
as provided for in amendment, "secure
and keep an inventory".

This team is not supposed to buy
anything in accordance with this
Procurement Act.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Thank
you.

Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, a sentence. 
So his statement cannot be
correct. I accept the Chairman’s first
amendment except the next one, I have
difficulties with.

Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, a sentence. That is one.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, I will come over to you. Hon
Members, if you take notice, the Hon
Majority Leader, I think consciously
introduced the word "take" and I think
that is in place of "procure". So he wants
us to have ‘ftake, secure and keep" an
inventory.

Hon Majority Leader, I am sure you said
that with an intention?

Hon Papa Owusu-Ankomah -rose-

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Papa Owusu-Ankomah, were you the last
but one contributor? Hon Akosua Frema
Osei-Opare, then I come to - »

Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Thank you
very much, Mr Speaker-

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: No. Hon
Osei-Opare, then I come to you.
I see your back, Hon Papa Owusu-
Ankomah. You do not see what is
happening at your back.

Mrs Akosua Frema Osei-Opare: Mr
Speaker, I have a big problem with the
establishment of this whole unit in the
way it has been couched. If we are looking

[MRS OSEI-OPARE]
at a Presidential (Transition) Bill, we are
looking at transfer of power, State and
whatever to the next Government.

12.00 noon

This Bill should be looking at the unit
so established under whatever Act; the
unit should be able to give a record to the
next Government as to what we have and
what we do not have.

Alhaji Haruna Iddrisu: Mr Speaker, a sentence. 
Theirs is just to oversee an
asset inventory and nothing more. In any
case, even if they are to engage -
[Interruption]

Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Speaker, a sentence. Mr Speaker, a sentence. Mr
Speaker, if you look at (xi), during the
Second Reading, we debated all those
matters.

We have moved beyond that; he
cannot take us back. It is stated here that
it is responsible for the procurement,
management and transfer. It is here; we
have gone through that. Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Mr Speaker,
I believe the Committee did not take
cognizance of the memorandum to this Bill
in proposing the amendment that is, delete
"procure".

So, I believe the Committee -
[lnterruption] -- may not have
considered the memorandum in detail
before proposing this amendment. So
really, "to procure" is relevant and should
be part of this amendment.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, this is a very critical stage of
this Consideration Stage and I believe we
should -

Some Hon Members -- rose-

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!

Hon Members, please, take your seats.
Hon Members at the back, please, take
your seats, so that we can seriously
participate in this.

If it is the object of the Bill that there
should be a permanent institution, we
must address our minds there accordingly.
It states "The Presidential Estates Unit is
established as continuing office and does
not terminate. . ."

Mr Kwame Osei-Prempeh: Mr
Speaker, after careful reading of the
memorandum, I believe there is no need
for that amendment. Mr Speaker, a sentence.

12.10 pm.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I will
call the Chairman of the Committee -

Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker--

Mr Second Deputy Speaker;
Chairman not yet.

Hon Boafo.

Mr Wifliam Ofori Boafo: Mr Speaker,
This is my statement - [Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Hon Members, I will suggest we take
our seats and consider this matter very,
very seriously.

Mr Boafo: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
The proper place that it should belong to,
will be the Office of the President Act,
where these structures are set out in the
Act. It should not be here.
More statements and more statements -
[Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, Order!

Mr Boafo: Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Boafo, some clafications?
Mr Boafo: Precisely so, Mr Speaker. Some
more statements. And some more statements:
"The officials of the Unit are to be
of State".
Some statement ending with a colon:
"some quote"
Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bo nsu: Mr Speaker,
what the Hon Member for Akropong is
indicating to us is some more statements.
Some statements alluding to clause 8 (1). _
Mr Speaker, a sentence.

Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyemang: Mr
Speaker, some statements.
Mr Speaker, a sentence. So I do not believe
that the assets of the Government for that
matter of the State can all be vested in a
so-called "Presidential Estates Unit".

12.20 p.m. 
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: With
these apparent more questions than
answers, I direct that we stand down
clause 8. Further deliberations would be
done outside the House and we would
make progress. _
Clauses 9 - Inventory of Assets.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, there are no listed amendment
for clauses 9 and 10.
Mr Joseph B Aidoo -rose--
Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyemang-
rose-- -


12.40 p.m.

Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyemang: Mr
Speaker,I would want to support him by
saying that we have met at midnight
before. "On the midnight of the 6"‘
Parliament is dissolved", and it is only
then that you can have the processes that
lead to the next set.
- [Interruption]
No, he is talking about before 7th. So
maybe, 5th , they would meet and then elect
a Speaker that would not be sworn~in and
only wait for the dissolution of Parliament
and they would only come for swearing-
in and not election on the 7th day.
[lnterruptions.] We should remember
that immediately after elections -
[lnterruptions.] . .
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!

Mr J. B. Aidoo: Mr Speaker, a sentence. Let us listen;
these are very important matters. 
12.50 p.m.
Mr J. B. Aidoo: Mr Speaker, a sentence. ."
Mr Speaker, a sentence. And according to the
Constitution, the Speaker is to be elected
by Members of Parliament; the
Constitution did not specify whether it
should be the new Members, to borrow
your Words - [Interruption] - please,
we have not got there. It is about
"Election of the Speaker" -
[Interruption] --No, article 100 is talking
about - Mr Speaker, a sentence."
Hon Member, you may continue.
Mr J. B. Aidoo: Yes, Mr Speaker,
agreed; but the point is that, who can take
part? What about the old Members?
Clause 95 is not very clear and my point is
that we should have the dissolution of
the existing Parliament firstt before we can
proceed to have another Parliament.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker:Very well.
Hon Members, the proposition is that,
no matter what happens, the dissolution
must take place before other Members
come to elect the Speaker.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Papa-
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: So I do not
have a proposal. All I am saying is that
the arguments that we are advancing.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker:Very well.
Thank you very much, Hon Papa Owusu-
Ankomah.
Alhaji Abukari Sumani: Mr Speaker,
we would be grateful if the former
Attorney-General and Minister for Justice
can help us with a definition of who is a
Member of Parliament?
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Yes, Hon
Chairman of the Committee - in fact, you
have made a statement --
Alhaji Abukari: It is not a statement;
it is very important.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: It is a
question loaded with a statement.
Alhaji Sumani: We ought to clear our
minds when the Constitution talks about
a Member of Parliament; that will tell us
what the Constitution means by a
"Member of Parliament".
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Mr Speaker,
if you are asking me about the Members
of the Fifth Parliament of the Republic of
Ghana, I will say that they are the Members
who Will be elected after the general
election of 2012.
Mr Bandua -rose-
Mr Felix Twumasi-Appiah: Mr
Speaker, I think the difficulty here has to
do with 48 hours before the 7th January
swearing-in of the Speaker.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Chairman
of the Committee, you would come in later.
Hon Chairman, you are listening to them
and your views will be very instructive at
the latter point. 
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: As Hon Papa
said, if the difficulty is that we want to
improve on the earlier arrangement, We can
have Parliament mid-night as usual, and
have the new Members of Parliament
sworn-in, let us say at 1.00 a.m.; have all
these arrangements in place before the 8
o’clock that my Hon good Friend was
suggesting.

Thank you very much.
Dr A. A. Osei - rose -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: That
would be very tidy.
Hon Dr Akoto Osei, you would wait a
while.
Hon Member- I want us to spread
the contribution as much as possible.
Mr Simon Osei-Mensah:Mr Speaker,
considering the importance of this
particular Bill and the amendments we
want to make, I wish we could suspend
debate or discussion on the Bill, so that
people can go back, read and reflect and
then we organize a Committee of the
Whole to discuss other welfare matters.
I think we need to suspend the debate
now and then consider other serious
Business of the House.
1.O0 p.m.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: This is a
House of debate and debate will continue.
Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker, a sentence. The
only problem that is arising is whether or
not the Members of Parliament- elect have
the capacity to take the election of the
Speaker before they are sworn in, and that
defect has been cured by article 102. So I
do not see any problem. There is no
problem.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, in fact, this is the only way
some of these important matters may be
addressed, is the way Hon Members are
doing now.
Hon Yieleh Chireh, you will continue.
Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, a sentence."
With this, the issue in this Bill that it
is trying to resolve is that, 48 hours or
two days before the President is sworn
in, you convene Members of Parliament-
elect to come and elect a Speaker.
[Interruption] Wait, I am coming to
the point. The old Parliament --
[Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: On a point of
order.
Mr Speaker, a sentence. Where
are they going to elect that Speaker? I
have already made reference to the fact
that in the last Parliament, Hon J. H.
Mensah raised an issue about even Where
to swear-in the President -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Yieleh Chireh, you will assume your seat
for the time being.
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: Even where to
swear-in the President and the Speaker,
he disagreed. His argument was
that the President and the Speaker must
be sworn-in before Parliament on the floor
of the House. On 4th January as of.
Mr Avoka -- rose -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon_
Majority Leader, do you have a point of
order?
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, a sentence. You
were on your feet and I recognised you}
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, a sentence."
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: That is
true and all Hon Members have no doubt
about that. It is not the issue.
Mr Avoka: Yes. That being so, two
days before the dissolution of Parliament,‘
Members of Parliament-elect who have
not yet been sworn-in can meet anywhere
in the country and elect the Speaker of
Parliament. The Constitution provides
that.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Any
Where in the country?
Mr Avoka: Yes, I mean the laws are
there. We can meet at the International
Conference Centre; we can meet here
during the day -

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader --- _
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, a sentence. They
are sworn-in under article 100. But the
Constitution says that before they are
even sworn-in -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I will
always think that Hon Members must meet
in this House, not meet anywhere and
elect a Speaker. The Hon Majority Leader
was leading us into temptation.
Mr Emmanuel A. Owusu-Ansah: On a
point of order.
Mr Speaker, a sentence. The Constitution creates one
Speaker at one time. When one Parliament
exits and another one comes into being,
the new one elects its own Speaker and
he/she is sworn-in. -
Mr Speaker, a sentence. 
It will create unnecessary trouble for us.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I think
there should be less of points of order as
possible, so that there will be
contributions and of course, Leaders in
particular will have all the contributions
they want to make.
Hon Minority "Leader, if you want to
speak, you may have to negotiate with
the Hon Majority Leader.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
it is just a point of information and I believe
Hon Members would advert their minds
to article 106 (11) -- Parliament has the
powers to postpone the operation of a law
that we make. It is as crystal clear as daylight.
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Yes, Hon
Majority Leader, you can continue.
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, a sentence. Article 95 (4) says:
"A quote quote quote quote
quote quote quote quote sentences
sentences quote ..." -

So if we meet as Hon Members of
Parliament without even taking an oath
as Such, we can elect a Speaker.
1.10p.m.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, that is not part of the
argument anyway.
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: Mr Speaker, a sentence.
I think that was in 19 - [Interruption]
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order! 
Mr Kwabena O. Darko-Mensah:
Mr Speaker, a sentence. I have no objection.
Mr Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr
Speaker, a sentence. I would
plead that the Majority Leader follows
through the suggestion diligently. It will
save us this forwards and backwards
movement. 
Mr Speaker, a sentence. 
Mr Speaker, another sentence. 
Mr Speaker, yet another sentence.
Mr Speaker, even more sentences. 
Having said that, Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: I would want
to second the Motion moved by the
Majority Leader for adjournment to enable
us move into a caucus of the Whole
Meeting. Mr Speaker, a sentence.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
Motion for adjournment has been moved
and seconded. ,
Question put and Motion agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT
The House was accordingly
adjourned at 1.20-p.m.till Wednesday, 15th
February, 2012 at 10.00 a.m.
