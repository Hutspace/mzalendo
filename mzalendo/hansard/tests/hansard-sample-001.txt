PRAYERS

Votes and Proceedings and the
Official Report

Madam Speaker: Hon Members,
Correction of Votes and Proceedings of
Friday, 10th February, 2012. 

Page 111-

Mr Joseph Y. Chireh: Madam
Speaker, I am sorry to turn you back.

But if you look at item 7 on page 7, it is
indicated that the Hon Majority Chief
Whip informed the House- Madam
Speaker, he did not just inform the House,
he presented the Business Statement to
the House for us to adopt. He did not
inform us. So it should be captured that
the Business Statement was presented to
the House instead of he informing us.

Madam Speaker: So, it should be
captured as presented to the House?

All right. 

. Page 11... 2O-[Pause.]

Hon Members, the Votes and
Proceedings of Friday, 10th February, 2012
as corrected are adopted as the true record
of proceedings. 

 Hon Members, we have the Official
Report of Thursday, 9th February, 2012.

Any corrections? 

Hon Members, in the absence of any
corrections, the Official Report of
Thursday, 9th February 2012 is adopted as
the true record of proceedings.

Dr A. A. Osei: Madam Speaker, I crave
your indulgence -- I have a slight
correction to the Official Report of
Thursday, 9th February, 2012.

Madam Speaker: What paragraph?
Dr. A.A- Osei: Madam Speaker,column
753, my second intervention, it reads as
follows:

"Page 13 in today's…"

There is something missing. It should
be:

". . . in today’s Order Paper..."

Madam Speaker: All right.

In which case, may I then change and
say that the Official Report of Thursday,
9th February, 2012 as corrected represents
the true record of proceedings.

Hon Members, I have admitted a
Statement from Hon Justice Joe Appiah,
Member of Parliament (MP) for Ablekuma
North.

10.50 am

 STATEMENTS

Valentine’s /Chocolate Day

Mr Justice Joe Appiah (NPP ---
Ablekuma North): Madam Speaker, it is
that time of the year again, when all lovers,
friends and relations look forward to being
showered with gifts of appreciation from
their loved ones and, it is with a feeling of
deep concern and great sorrow that I rise
to make a few pertinent observations in
respect of the celebration of Valentine’s
Day in Ghana these days. -

[MR APPIAH]

Madam Speaker, Valentine’s Day which
falls on February 14, every year, is a much
awaiting day all over the world, and
Ghana is no exception to this anticipation.
Although the genesis of this celebration
began with the naming of a day after one
early Christian martyr named Valentine,
and was established by Pope Gelasius I
in 500 AD, it was later deleted from the
Roman calendar of saints in 1969 by Pope
Paul VI, yet its religious observance was
still permitted, and has become a tradition
through which lovers express their love
for each other.

Madam Speaker, some years back, on
the Ghanaian scene, my observation to
this celebration was the wearing of red
outfit, which was used as a sign of
recognition. However, with time, the trend
died out, bringing some relief to many
who opposed the idea.

The patriotism of Valentine’s Day was
named "Chocolate Day" some years back
and when it began, it was welcomed with
enthusiasm, and chocolate became the
order of the day during this fetish
celebration. However, with the increase
in chocolate prices, one may ask if the
chocolate idea will be encouraged.

It would have been interesting if the
Cocoa Production Company reduced the
prices of chocolate just for this occasion,
to enable as many people as possible
enjoy a bar of chocolate.

Madam Speaker, with the advent of
Valentine’s Day becoming Chocolate Day
in Ghana, it was assumed that the cost
incurred previously such as promiscuity
and licentiousness became so widespread
that no one had the gumption to call the
participants to order and eventually
marriages ended up on rocks as the
Winsome young girls attracted and
mesmerised married men into having affairs
with them and breaking their homes on
account of Valentine’s Day celebration.

Madam Speaker, in some instances,
hotels are fully booked just to celebrate
Valentine’s Day. I hope and pray that this
time, the celebration would be done
cautiously and without any immoral
attachment to it. 

Madam Speaker, with the high
prevalence of the obnoxious HIV/AIDS
globally, it would be appreciated if in the
observation of this promising day, the
various electronic media will sensitise
listeners more on chocolates and educate
the youth.

However, Madam Speaker, I would want
before I resume my seat, to wish all a Happy
Valentine’s Day and Chocolate Day.

Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Mr Isaac Osei (NPP - Subin):
Madam Speaker, I thank you for the
opportunity to contribute to the
Statement, which has been ably delivered
by Hon Justice Joe Appiah (Member for
Ablekuma North), calling our attention to
the significance of Valentine’s Day and
its observance.

But I join the Hon Member in wishing
all Ghanaians a happy Valentine’s Day and
also National Chocolate Day.

Madam Speaker, I thank you for the
opportunity to make these few comments.

Madam Speaker: Thank you, Hon
Member.

Hon Members, this is the end of
Statement time.

Shall we move on to commencement of
Public Business?

 Yes Deputy Majority Leader, laying of
Papers Minister for Local Government and
Rural Development, item 4 (a) (i).

Alhaji Abdul-Rashid Pelpuo: Madam
Speaker, the Deputy Minister for Local
Government and rural Development is on
his way coming, and as a result, I would
want to request that we defer item 4 (a)
and take item 4 (b). If that is acceptable,
I would request your permission and the
indulgence of my Hon Friends on the
other side of the House to allow the
Deputy Minister for Finance and
Economic Planning to lay the Paper on
behalf of the Minister for Finance and
Economic Planning.

Madam Speaker: Deputy Leader, you
want us to defer item 4 (a) (i) and (ii)?

Alhaji Pelpuo: That is so, Madam
Speaker.

Madam Speaker: What about (b)?

Alhaji Pelpuo: So We can go on to (b).

With your permission, the Deputy
Minister may lay the Paper.

Mr Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: It is
all right. 

PAPERS .

By the Deputy Minister for Finance and
Economic Planning (Mr Seth Terkpeh)
(on behalf of the Minister for Finance and
Economic Planning) -

Addendum to the Master Facility
Agreement between the Government of
the Republic of Ghana and the China
development Bank (CDB) for a loan of
US$3.0 billion to finance infrastructure
development projects under the Ghana
Shared Growth and Development Agenda
(GSGDA). 

Referred to the joint Committee on
Finance and Poverty Reduction Strategy.

Dr A. A. Osei: Madam Speaker, the
first one was referred to the joint
Committee on Finance and Poverty
Reduction Strategy and not Mines and
Energy.

Madam Speaker: Did we not turn it?

Dr A. A. Osei: No. This is the Master
Facility Agreement. This is not the
Subsidiary Agreement. It was referred to
the joint Committee on Finance and
Poverty Reduction Strategy.

11.00 am

Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Madam
Speaker, the Hon Member for Old Tafo,
who is the Ranking Member is drawing
attention that the referral of this, originally,
was made to the joint Committee on
Finance and Poverty Reduction Strategy.

Mr Joe Ghartey -- rose -

Madam Speaker: Is it on the same
issue?

Mr Joe Ghartey: Madam Speaker,
what has occurred raises the question or
the debate whether the House should
approve signed Agreements or the House
should approve draft Agreements.
Madam Speaker, the House has tried both
methods, so to speak, and both methods
have raised their own problems.

Madam Speaker, if you look at article
181(1) of the Constitution, and with your
permission, I beg to quote:

"(1) Parliament may, by a resolution
supported by the votes of a
majority of all the Members of
Parliament, authorise the
Government to enter into an
agreement for the granting of a loan
out of any public fund or public
account.

(2)An agreement entered into under
clause (1) of this article shall be laid
before Parliament and shall not come
into operation unless it is approved
by a resolution. of Parliament."

It is because of article 181(5) which
talks about the necessary modifications
when we are dealing with international
business or economic transactions that
We read the two previous articles we have
read.

Madam Speaker, there have been times
in the past where Parliament has approved
an Agreement. It happened in the case of
the Vodafone Agreement. The difficulty
that we faced then was that after it had
been approved by Parliament, Members
of Parliament raised concerns about the
Agreement -- legitimate concerns I dare
say - and it was taken into consideration 

11.10am.

Madam Speaker: Hon Minority
Leader, do we allow the Hon Deputy
Minister to lay it?

Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu -- [Nodded].

Madam Speaker: Hon Deputy
Minister, I think you have permission to
lay the Papers. 

11.15A.M.--

[MR SECOND DEPUTY SPEAKER IN THE
CHAIR]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, Presidential (Transition) Bill,
2010 at the Consideration Stage.

BILLS - CONSIDERATION STAGE
Presidential (Transition) Bill, 2010
[Resumption of debate from 08-02-
2012]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Chairman of the Committee, have you
reached some consensus on clause 5?

Chairman of the Committee (Mr
Emmanuel K. Bandua: We have not met
to discuss it. But I have a suggestion to
make that if it will be possible, we define
what "eminent" means in the
interpretation clause and then we move
on. I do not know; we have not met on it
but that is --
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Chairman, we prefer that this winnowing
and consensus building is taken very
seriously so that we make progress on
these matters. --

Mr Bandua: All right

Clause 6 -- Handing over Notes.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, there is no listed amendment
for clause 6 and it is for the consideration
of the House. 

Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
I think we have done some amendments
with respect to clause 6 and I think the
Question was put on that one earlier. It is
not as if no amendments have been done.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So, that
means we have concluded clause 6 and
amended it? It stands part of the Bill.

Clause 7 -Availability of the handing
over notes

Mr Kwabena Okyere Darko-Mensah:
Mr Speaker, I beg to move, clause 7,
subclause (2), paragraph (b), sub-
paragraph (i), delete "the Speaker" and
substitute "Parliament".

Mr Speaker, like I said the last time, I
believe that if the Report is submitted to
Parliament, then we are sure it will end up
on the floor of the House. But when we
make it in the form of ending up at the
Speaker’s desk, then it will be at the
discretion of the Speaker whether it ends
up with Hon Members or not, more so,
when the information that will be
contained in the Report will be very
germane to a lot of Hon Members and
when we are going to demand the 30 days
before an election.

I believe that it is very critical that Hon
Members of the House, the peoples’
representatives have copies of the Report.
That was Why I proposed that we change
"Speaker" to "Parliament".

Mr Bandua: I think I support the
amendment- That will conform with
paragraph (b), subparagraphs (ii) and (iv).

Mr Ghartey: Mr Speaker, I do not know
I can urge the Hon Member who moved
the amendment to consider a friendly
amendment. Mr. Speaker, that friendly
amendment is in the nature of the deletion
of "Council of State". Mr Speaker, I say
that because the President-elect
represents the Executive, Parliament
represents the Legislature, then the Chief
Justice-- perhaps, if we are using
Parliament, "then we should ‘say the
Judiciary, then the Judiciary is
represented, the three arms of Government
are represented and one copy goes to
National Archives.

11.20am

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon Joe
Ghartey, after that rare submission, what
do you suggest?

Mr Ghartey: Mr Speaker, I would
suggest a deletion of the Council of State
in subparagraph (iii) and I would suggest
a substitution of the Chief Justice with
the Judiciary in line with what was
proposed by my Hon Friend, Mr Kwabena
Darko-Mensah when he said, instead of
the "Speaker", we should say
"Parliament"; so instead of the "Chief
Justice" we should say the "Judiciary"
and then I suggest also a deletion of the
"Council of State".

Mr Darko~Mensah: Mr Speaker, I
believe that if you look at the other
amendment I proposed, that is for clause
(7), I have already made proposal for the
substitution of "Justices" for "the
Judiciary." So I believe that it is in line
with-

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So that
would come in, anyway.

But what about reference to the Council
of State? 

Mr Darko-Mensahz: Mr Speaker, I
believe that even though he has made that
submission, the Council of State is
regarded more or less in certain quarters
like the second chamber of Parliament and
I believe that giving them a copy of the
Report will not actually harm anybody. If
you are looking at adding an additional
list, like the Electoral Commission, National
House of Chiefs, I believe that we cannot
belabour it; we can always give them a
copy.

I think that maybe, we should rather
add the National House of Chiefs instead
of deleting the "Council of State". I believe
that the National House of Chiefs would
be appropriate if we can just add it.

Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker, I think that
the Council of State, by virtue of the fact
that they are in a unique position, they
advise the Presidency. So I think there is
nothing wrong bringing them in here. So
I do not see why we should delete it. If we
want "to add more, I do not see the
relevance, unless we are able to justify it.
But for the Council of State, I do not think
it creates any harm if we leave it in there.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Then we
still have for clause 7 (ii), delete
"Speaker", substitute "Parliament",

Mr William O. Boafo: Mr Speaker, a
careful look at the provision appears to
establish some consistency. Previous
references are not to institutions, but to
offices, like Regional Ministers, Deputy
Regional Ministers and Ministers. And
even, if you come to clause (7) (1), the
original is not to be given to the Office of
the President, but it is to be given to the
President.

Mr Speaker, I think it is in order that we
retain the Speaker and the Chief Justice
because it is more consistent with the
previous arrangement, recognizing offices
rather than institutions.

Mr Speaker, we would want to avoid
the situation where an occupant of the
office who should accept responsibility
for what has happened, who should not
disclaim knowledge of what has
happened, would say that the thing was
sent to an institution and it never came to
my office, so I do not know anything
about it. This is another mischief which
we would like to avoid.

So Mr Speaker, I would support the
original rendition in the Bill.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
point being canvassed on both sides is
that we want to ensure responsibility and
that those who receive it can be held
personally and officially accountable for
the document in the future.

11.30 a.m. 

Mr Joseph B. Aidoo: Mr. Speaker, if it
is a question of removing any doubt about
the institution that would receive the
copies of the Report, then I would
propose that in the case of the Speaker,
we add the "Office of the Speaker". In the
case of the Chief Justice, we add the
"Office of the Chief Justice", so that we
are very sure that the document is going
to that particular office. But of course, I
support the original rendition that the
Speaker, the Chief Justice and so on and
so forth -

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Very
well. 

In line with the position taken by the
Hon Majority Leader and Hon Boafo -

Mr J. B. Aidoo: Exactly so. So if  we
want to qualifyit more, then we just add
the "Office"; that is, the "Office of the
Speaker", the "Office ofthe Chief Justice".
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Yes, the
last word, then we move on with the
amendment, then we put the Question -

Mr Darko-Mensah: Mr Speaker, I
strongly believe that we need to go with
the amendment. If we take all the reports
that are actually being handled by State
institutions, they are actually presented
to Parliament.

I believe that the people’s representatives
should have a copy without it being at
the discretion of any other person. I
therefore, propose that we should go with
this amendment that instead of being the
"Speaker", it should be "Parliament".

Mr Second Deputy Speaker:Thank
you very much.

Yes, Chairman of the Committee, final
word. 
Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker, if you look at
subparagraphs (iii) and (iv), the offices -
- the Council of State and the National
Archives" -- and they have not been
addressed to the head of the institutions.
So we may have to look at that and ensure
that there is some uniformity. There should
be some uniformity because in sub-
paragraph (iii), we have the Council of
State and not the Chairman of the Council
of State and then in subparagraph (iv),
we have the National Archives and not
the head of the institution.

So there should be uniformity. I would
not mind if we make it uniform. So that if
we should have institutions, we would
have institutions throughout and if we
have heads of institutions, it should be
heads of institutions throughout.

That is my observation, MrSpeaker.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I will put
the Question.
Alhaji Pelpuo -rose-

Mr. Second Deputy Speaker: I think we
have had quite an exhaustive debate on
this matter

Hon Deputy Majority Leader, I
recognize you.

Alhaji Pelpuo: Mr Speaker, I just
wanted to identify a differentiation
between sending it to the Speaker and
sending it to Parlilament. If it is to the
Speaker, he/she will handle it
administratively because it is a letter
coming from outside to him or her. He or
she will decide to handle it
administrative1y--refer it to the Clerk and
then they will decide to put it anywhere,
But if it is to Parliament, it belongs to the
institution and that everybody associated
with the institution, the stakeholders are
all to be aware that it is lodged.
So when you say "Chief Justice", she
can just make reference to the Registrar
and that is it. But if it is to the Judiciary,
then she would be compelled to share it.
So we have to understand the distinction
between the two before we vote on it.

Dr Anthony A. Osei - rose -

Mr Second Deputy Speaker:Thank
you very much. I will put the Question.

Hon Dr Osei, I recognize you from the
other side as the last word -

Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, Hon Darko-
Mensah talked about consistency. The
Hon Majority got up and said that it was
all right to leave the "Speaker" and the
"Chief Justice". But when it comes to the
Council of State, it is not addressed to the
Chairman; it is not consistent. It could be
taken to any person in the Council of State.
But it is the same logic. 

So if we want to be consistent, then we
must accept the amendment. It is only
consistent with what it is here. Otherwise,
it should be the Chairman of the Council
of State and whoever heads the National
Archives for consistency.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Very
well "

Question put and amendment agreed
to.

Mr Avoka -rose-
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, do you want to take a
step further to my ruling? Then we would
proceed, I do not mind. 

Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, I thought the
voting was so close that if you took a
second - [Laughter] - Well, with due
respect, I thought that the shouting was
such that it was very difficult to easily
discern the AYES and the NOES -

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: It was not
dificult for me. The AYES had it; the
amendment is carried.

Clause 7, further amendment standing
in the name of Hon Darko-Mensah --

Mr Darko-Mensah: Mr Speaker, I beg
to move, clause 7,, subclause (2),
paragraph (b), subparagraph (ii), delete
"Chief Justice" and substitute "Judiciary".
This is to conform with what we have
already. 

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, it is virtually consequential, I
will put the Question.

Alhaji Pelpuo: Mr Speaker, it does
appear to me that we did not have enough
discussion on this matter before the
voting is taking place. So may I suggest
that even though we have voted on the
two, because we are at the Consideration
Stage where flexibility is allowed, we step
this matter down until we have more
exhaustive discussion on it.

11.40 am.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Deputy Majority Leader, you will agree
with me that if it is a matter of exhaustive
debate, we really have had it and so much,
so that when got up, when I said I was
going to put the Question, I nevertheless
allowed - and any other Hon Member who
had not contributed was given a further
chance.

In the circtunstances, under Standing
Order 113, I will call for a division because
the voice vote is not clear. But if that is
what Hon Members wish over this small
matter, then we will call for a division; we
will call for a headcount. If Hon Members
feel it is a matter over which we should
have a headcount, so do I because I
honestly cannot make a determination on
the voice vote and that is what the rule
says.

The Leadership should co-operate, so
that we proceed accordingly.
Standing Order 113 (1):
"When the Question has been put
by Mr. Speaker at the conclusion of
the debate, the votes shall be taken
by voices "Aye" and "No",
provided that Mr. Speaker may in
his discretion instead of declaring
the result on the voice votes call for
a headcount." '

So let us call for a headcount and close
the matter. '

Hon Majority Leader, do you want to -

Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, I wanted to
draw your attention with due respect to
Standing Order 113 (2) and it says:
"A Member may call for headcount
or division if the opinion of Mr.
Speaker on the voice vote is
challenged." 

To the best of my knowledge, no Hon
Member has called for it yet.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: This is
because I have not determined the matter.
I have not pronounced on "Ayes" having
one or "Noes" having one and the rules
allow me before I make a pronouncement,
to proceed the way I am proceeding, very
much in line with the rules.

Question put and the House counted:

AYES - 38
NOES - 41
ABSTENTIONS -

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
amendment is lost.

I will put the Question on the entire
clause -

Mr Dery: Mr Speaker, I just wanted,
with permission, to draw your attention
to a very important point.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: As of
now, we do not know those who
abstained- Let us make progress.

Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Mr Speaker,
clause 7, we have the National Archives.
That is not the designation; it is Public
Records and Archives Administration. So
if that could be corrected.

Mr Speaker, I beg to move, clause 7
subclause (2), paragraph (b),
subparagraph (iv),substitute "Public
Records and Archives Administration" in
place of the National Archives as it
appears on clause7 (2) (b) (iv).

Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, I support the
amendment I think that it should be carried
because that is the new name.

Question put and amendment agreed
to.

Clause 7 as amended ordered to stand
part of the Bill.

Clause 8 --- Presidential Estates Unit

Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker, I beg to move,
clause 8, subclause (1), paragraph (a), line
1, delete "procure, in accordance with the
Public Procurement Act, 2003 (Act 663),
secure" and insert "take". -

Mr Speaker, the reason for this
amendment is to separate the taking of
inventory from the procurement of the
assets. That is the rationale for this
amendment. ’We want to separate the two.

11.50 am.

Alhaji H. Iddrisu: Mr Speaker, I
would request the Chairman of
the Committee to give further
particulars why he even thinks that
he should make reference to the Public
Procurement Act. I think all
institutions of State are required to
uphold the laws that are passed by
this august House. Are we going to
say that every entity that we create,
we must necessarily say that subject
to Public Procurement Act?
Once there is an Act which governs
and supports the procurement process in
this country, we need not make specific
reference to it.

Mr Bandua: I do not think you have
listened to my amendment -

Mr Second" Deputy Speaker: Hon
Chairman of the Committee, you may make
your point, addressing -

Mr Bandua: I do not see the relevance
of the point he is raising. If it goes on --
first, we have tried to separate it -so the
Procurement Act does not come here at
all. We have removed it from that section.
So I do not know why he is raising this
issue.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I think
the Hon Minister‘s point is, do you need
to mention, "in accordance with Public
Procurement Act" at all? This is because
we should abide by the law anyway and if
so, are we in all such laws going to be
mentioning "in accordance with Public
Procurement Act"? That is a point I think
we must please -

Mr Bandua: When an Act applies
rightly in a situation, I think there is
nothing right mentioning -

Mr J. B. Aidoo: Mr Speaker, I do not
know what the Chairman is doing. This is
because the essence of the amendment
as has been proposed by the Committee
is to remove that phrase starting from:
"procure in accordance with the Public
Procurement Act. . ." So that the rendition
will read,
"to take, secure and keep an
inventory of the assets and
properties of Government which are
assets and properties not vested in
the Lands Commission established
under article 258 of the
Constitution".

So in this case, "Public Procurement"
-, and all those aspects do not come in
at all. 

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So that--

Prof. Gyan-Baffour: l think the
Chairman made it very clear that he is
trying to do that to, take away
"procurement" from this Presidential
Estate Unit. So they do not have the right
to procure. If they cannot procure, why
do you talk about procurement law? ls that
not the issue? That is the issue.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Where
"procure" means purchasing or Where
"procure" means obtaining. I would want
us to address our minds to it. Where
"procure" may mean obtaining something
and that one, no procurement law comes
in. We may not necessarily have to take
away "procure" but depending upon what
the intendment of the word "procure"
here is, if it is to obtain something Without
necessarily going to purchase
something--

Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, just like my.
Colleagues, the last Hon Member has
indicated, the provision of the Public
Procurement Act, 2003 in this Bill is
misplaced. This is a transition team. They
are intended to take assets o the
Presidency, so that the new President who
comes in knows what he is inheriting.
They are not supposed to procure and
advertise or selective tendering and
procure anythingfor the benefit of the
presidential estate. No.

They are supposed to take inventory
of the items, so that when the President
takes over, then he has a list of items he is
inheriting. When he is leaving office, they
know what he left behind. That is the
intention and therefore, the provision here
of Public Procurement Act is misplaced.
So at the winnowing committee, we
made the amendment, that "take, secure
and keep an inventory" -- They are "to
take, secure and keep inventory" of the
rest of them. They are not supposed to
procure anything --

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, the amendment is
intended to do what-

Order! Order!

Mr Avoka: We are to delete from (a) to
"procure in accordance with the Public
Procurement Act, 2003, (Act 663)." We
delete all that and then we insert "to take",
as provided for in amendment, "secure
and keep an inventory". That is the
intendment. To take the property that is
in place. To take custody of the assets -
- like you are going into a new bungalow,
you take custody of what is there.

This team is not supposed to buy
anything in accordance with this
Procurement Act. They are buying
nothing; they are procuring nothing.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Thank
you.

Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, I would
have agreed with the Majority Leader except
-- [Interruptions] -- the Chairman of
the Committee, in the next amendment,
talks about procurement -
[Interruptions] The Majority Leader
should avdert his mind to - he says the
object is not to procure but in the next
amendment, the Committee is asking them
to procure. So his statement cannot be
correct. I accept the Chairman’s first
amendment except the next one, I have
difficulties with.

Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, the first
amendment is correct, in the sense that
you are taking inventory and securing the
assets. That is one.

The idea of introducing procurement
as a function for the Presidential Estates
Unit is something that I do not want us to
put in this law. This is because, one, what
we want to do is that each Ministry or
department that provides assets to officers
is a basic thing that they do. _

Now, unless you are talking about the
transitional team which is only for you to
budget for the day of handing over, the
ceremonies connected with that, we
should not clothe this Administrator-
General with any powers to procurement.
Because each agency already procures for
the officers that will be taken account of.
So if the Chairman agrees, he should
not even move the Motion for
procurement at all. It is not necessary and
it is appointed by the President for the
purpose for which any procurement under
the presidency can be done for the
purpose of this office.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, I will come over to you. Hon
Members, if you take notice, the Hon
Majority Leader, I think consciously
introduced the word "take" and I think
that is in place of "procure". So he wants
us to have ‘ftake, secure and keep" an
inventory.

Hon Majority Leader, I am sure you said
that with an intention? 

The Hon Majority Leader
unfortunately is not with me. That "take,
secure and keep" and to'avoid some of
the possible trappings of that word
"procure" which in a way, has become a
term of art-

Hon Papa Owusu-Ankomah -rose-

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Papa Owusu-Ankomah, were you the last
but one contributor? Hon Akosua Frema
Osei-Opare, then I come to - »

Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Thank you
very much, Mr Speaker-

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: No. Hon
Osei-Opare, then I come to you.
I see your back, Hon Papa Owusu-
Ankomah. You do not see what is
happening at your back.

Mrs Akosua Frema Osei-Opare: Mr
Speaker, I have a big problem with the
establishment of this whole unit in the
way it has been couched. If we are looking

[MRS OSEI-OPARE]
at a Presidential (Transition) Bill, we are
looking at transfer of power, State and
whatever to the next Government. If we
want to recommend that it will be useful
to have such an establishment in the
Presidency which I subscribed. I do not
really believe that it belongs to this law.

12.00 noon

This Bill should be looking at the unit
so established under whatever Act; the
unit should be able to give a record to the
next Government as to what we have and
what we do not have. As it has been
couched, it looks like we are now
establishing a unit which would now
begin to purchase, sell and to take
inventory; that does not belong to a
Transition Bill.

I think we should look into our laws
and begin to establish what units should
go under the Presidency. But certainly, it
cannot be part of a transition. The
transition is about accountability, it is
about that estate actually handing over
the records that they have at the end of
the Government to the next Government._

Alhaji Haruna Iddrisu: Mr Speaker, I
believe we can make progress if the
Chairman of the Committee can assure us
that having regard - [Interruption] - even
though I know that our rules would not
permit that - I agree With some aspects
of the argument that the Presidential
Estates Unit has no business doing
procurement. Theirs is just to oversee an
asset inventory and nothing more. In any
case, even if they are to engage -
[Interruption]

Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, on a point
of order.

Mr Speaker, during the Second
Reading, we went through all that the Hon
Minister is talking about. Mr Speaker, look
at the memorandum, we are here
considering the amendments and he is
taking us back to the object of the Bill. Mr
Speaker, if you look at (xi), during the
Second Reading, we debated all those
matters.

We have moved beyond that; he
cannot take us back. It is stated here that
it is responsible for the procurement,
management and transfer. It is here; we
have gone through that. Mr Speaker, I
think they are slowing the progress -

Alhaji H. Iddrisu: Mr Speaker, mine is
that the Chairman should just assure us
that having regard to the first amendment
he has moved, supported by the "Hon
Majority Leader which the Hon Member
for Amenfi East (Mr J. B. Aidoo) said that
we should delete those words starting
from "procure" and put in "take". That is
appropriate, but we must be assured that
the second part of his amendment would
be abandoned-and we know that there is
no exercise which has to do with
procurement, then we can make progress.

Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Mr Speaker,
I believe the Committee did not take
cognizance of the memorandum to this Bill
in proposing the amendment that is, delete
"procure". Mr Speaker, if you look at the
memorandum-pages (x) and (xi) and with
your permission, I beg to read. The last
paragraph of page (x) says:
"The Presidential Estates Unit is
established as a continuing office
and does not terminate with the
termination of the transition. It is
responsible for the procurement,
management and transfer . . ."

So, I believe the Committee -
[lnterruption] -- may not have
considered the memorandum in detail
before proposing this amendment. So
really, "to procure" is relevant and should
be part of this amendment.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, this is a very critical stage of
this Consideration Stage and I believe we
should -

Some Hon Members -- rose-

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!

Hon Members, please, take your seats.
Hon Members at the back, please, take
your seats, so that we can seriously
participate in this.

If it is the object of the Bill that there
should be a permanent institution, we
must address our minds there accordingly.
It states "The Presidential Estates Unit is
established as continuing office and does
not terminate. . ."

So that Members would really address
themselves as to -- [Interruptions]

I am afraid, Hon Members, we need to
pay attention, so that we know exactly
what we want and translate it into the Bill.
And I want Hon Members to please,
address their minds to this important
matter, so that procurement and other
matters, whatever we really intend, should
be reflected in the law.

Mr Kwame Osei-Prempeh: Mr
Speaker, after careful reading of the
memorandum, I believe there is no need
for that amendment. Mr Speaker, I believe
that my Friends, the Hon Member for
Ayawaso West Wuogon (Mrs Frema Osei-
Opare) and the Hon Minister for
Communications (Alhaji Haiuna Iddrisu)
fell into a trap that it was part of the
transition team and therefore, it would go
with the transition. I believe it is the same
trap that the Committee fell in. But the unit
is being established as a permanent unit
and part of its functions will be to procure.

Mr Speaker, I believe the Committee
itself is satisfied. This is because the
subsequent amendment talks about
procurement by the unit and if they are
going to establish the procurement
function in another clause, why delete it
from this place?
Mr Speaker, I believe that the unit being
established, a permanent one to procure,
take and manage asset belonging to
Government, so that no executive arm will
be doing that. It is _a permanent unit and
therefore, there is no need to disturb that
clause and my Hon Friend should
withdraw the amendment and let us make
some progress.

12.10 pm.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I will
call the Chairman of the Committee -

Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker--

Mr Second Deputy Speaker;
Chairman not yet.

Hon Boafo.

Mr Wifliam Ofori Boafo: Mr Speaker,
the factors which motivated the
Committee to make this amendment are to
ensure - [Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Hon Members, I will suggest we take
our seats and consider this matter very,
very seriously.

In fact, I allowed some references to
the two amendments because of the fact
that we need to look at this matter in a
very holistic manner before we are misled.
So if you will please resume your seats
and have some order. Hon Boafo
continue.

Mr Boafo: Mr Speaker, it was the
desire of the Committee and even at the
winnowing level, to ensure that the
transition team does not dabble in
procurement. That is why the Committee
is proposing that we take the entire
opening phrase and substitute "take".
Mr Speaker, the point is that, if there is
the necessity to have a "Presidential
Estates Unit", I think this particular
legislation is not the place where it should
be. We accept the principle that there
should be a "Presidential Estates Unit"
but it should not be in this legislation.
The proper place that it should belong to,
will be the Office of the President Act,
where these structures are set out in the
Act. It should not be here.
The essence of the transition team is
to take inventory and after they have taken
-the inventory, to make their
recommendations and hand it over to the
"Presidential Estates Unit" for
management and control and for
everything. It is not for them to -
[Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, Order!

Mr Boafo; Mr Speaker, we have been
told in this House, it has been hammered
in this House, that we should not ignore
the Memorandum. How should we
constitute ourselves by the Memorandum
if we feel that what is in the Act is not
good? We do not have to bind ourselves
by What is in the Memorandum. That is
the essence of the Bill being brought to
this House for us to take the process and
ensure that we make good laws here. So
if the Memorandum is misdirecting us to
establish a "Presidential Estates Unit" by
this Presidential Transition Act, Mr
Speaker, we are not bound to look at it.

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Boafo, you would want to submit
emphatically not with an "it" but then it is
your view that so far as this paragraph is
concerned in the Memorandum, it is
misleading and it should not be reflected
in the law?
Mr Boafo: Precisely so, Mr Speaker. If
you look at the Memorandum, apart from
the fact that it is saying that the Committee
is going to be a permanent office, it goes
on to elaborate the role of the "Presidential
Estates Unit" should be a permanent unit,
it goes on to elaborate what it should do
in the Memorandum. And what it should
do in the Memorandum is not reflected in
the Bill. It says that:
"The officials of the Unit are to be
responsible for the maintenance of
the register of the executive assets
of State".
Then it says:
"Additionally, the Unit is
empowered to make budgetary
allocation to cover the cost of
transitions and inaugurations. . ."
Mr Speaker, in the alternative, if they
want us to maintain this "Presidential
Estates Unit" in this Bill, then the
provision here regarding the Presidential
Unit is insuficient. My contention is that,
it should not be in this Bill, it should go to
the ofice of the President Act.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bo nsu: Mr Speaker,
what the Hon Member for Akropong is
indicating to us is a completely different
thing. If the argument is that, the
provisions under clause 8 are insufficient
and we need to expand same, that is a
different ball game.
Now, what the Chairman seeks to do
by this amendment of subclause I is that,
we want to distinguish between the
submission of an inventory to the
incoming Administration from other
statutory functions involving
procurement which the Chairman has now
captured in subclause (5). Mr Speaker,
that is the import of what the Chairman
and the winnowing committee has done.
So, I would entreat my Hon Colleagues
to understand it from that point of View
that we want by, one; to establish what
they must be doing in the transition
period, taking inventory, submitting same,
accounting to the incoming
Administration, the inventory of the
assets available to the presidency. That
is what the Chairman seeks to do with that
amendment in clause 8 (1). _
Mr Speaker, he goes further to suggest
that we incorporate a new subclause in
clause 8 (5) captured under (v).I think
the proper place for it and of course, that
will be subject to the directions of the
draftspersons, would be that,_ it should
follow after clause 8 (1) so that we will
have that one as 8 (2) and that will be
separating the functions of the
"Presidential Estates Unit".
I agree with the Hon Member for
Akropong (Mr William Ofori Boafo) that
perhaps, we need to expand the scope of
activity as prescribed by the
Memorandum. But as I said, it is a different
ball game and we can come to that.

So let us accept the amendment
proposed by the Chairman and then We
move further to also adopt item (v) as (2)
and we then can proceed from there.
As to the expansion, I believe the Hon
Member for Akropong is right in his
suggestion that we should look to
expanding the spectrum of activities for
the "Presidential Estate Unit".
Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyemang: Mr
Speaker, I will need a bit of explanation
myself as regards the "Presidential Estates
Unit" and the Act which is seeking to
establish it.
Mr Speaker, it talks about:
"to keep an inventory of the assets
and properties of the Government
which are assets and properties not
vested in the Lands Commission
established under article 258 of the
Constitution."
Mr Speaker, if you go to article 258, it
talks only about land. So I do not believe
that the assets of the Government for that
matter of the State can all be vested in a
so-called "Presidential Estates Unit".
Estate by its definition refers to only
landed property. In any case, if the landed
property is not transferred into the name
of somebody else, then the Lands
Commission remains the owner. Those of
us who have lands which are given to us
by the Land Commission, 99 years, 50
years, Mr Speaker, at the end of 50 years
or 99 years, the Lands Commission can
take it back, because they have vested in
them.
So I am having a lot of difficulty trying
to link clause 258 Which talks about the
Lands Commission and what this
particular "Presidential Estates Unit" is
trying to do.
If I do not understand,'then the wider
public may not understand. So maybe, I
need some explanation why it is being
proposed that this Bill either by the
amendment or even by the substantive
one in the Bill is saying that, ". . . is
responsible for purchase and acquisition
in accordance with. . .," and here it says:
"shall in accordance with public
procurement secure and keep an
inventory of all the assets not
vested in the. . ."
So who is taking what? I think the
drafters need to make it clearer and then
the confusion in all our minds would have
been averted.
I have a difficulty in the Presidential
Estates Unit being charged with this
onerous task nationwide, I suppose, of
everything that goes for the Government.
Is that what it is meant?I would want some
explanation from the Hon Chairman of the
Committee, or those who think they
understand, to let me understand, so that
I can make an informed decision on it. This
This is because as it is now, it is not clear
to me. So maybe, the Chairman of the
Committee can help.
12.20 p.m. 
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: With
these apparent more questions than
answers, I direct that we stand down
clause 8. Further deliberations would be
done outside the House and we would
make progress. _
Clauses 9 - Inventory of Assets.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, there are no listed amendment
for clauses 9 and 10.
Mr Joseph B Aidoo -rose--
Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyemang-
rose-- -


12.40 p.m.

Mr Hackman Owusu-Agyemang: Mr
Speaker,I would want to support him by
saying that we have met at midnight
before. "On the midnight of the 6"‘
Parliament is dissolved", and it is only
then that you can have the processes that
lead to the next set. I am suggesting that
if we have all thought about this, Mr
Speaker, that midnight of the 6"‘ you
summon the new Members of Parliament
(MPs) to come and between midnight and
10.00 o’clock or 12 o’clock or 2.00 o’clock
as suggested, you would have done it.
Then everything would be in tandem with
the constitutional provisions that we
have.
- [Interruption]
No, he is talking about before 7th. So
maybe, 5th , they would meet and then elect
a Speaker that would not be sworn~in and
only wait for the dissolution of Parliament
and they would only come for swearing-
in and not election on the 7th day.
If this is what we intend to achieve,
then let us say so, so that it becomes clear.
But I am looking at the arrangement
around that time. Mr Speaker, we need to
be very practical in pursuing this agenda.
[lnterruptions.] We should remember
that immediately after elections -
[lnterruptions.] . .
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!

Mr J. B. Aidoo: Mr Speaker, the
Minority Leader raised a very fundamental
issue -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order! 
Hon Members, order. Let us listen;
these are very important matters. 
12.50 p.m.
Mr J. B. Aidoo: Mr Speaker, it is in
respect of the election of the Speaker and
as he read, that is, article 95 -
"There shall be a Speaker of
Parliament who shall be elected by
the Members of Parliament . ."
Mr Speaker, 48 hours, before the
swearing-in of the President, as they are
being indicated and before the dissolution
of Parliament -
Mr Speaker, if the Members-elect are
to come and swear-in a Speaker, the old
Members would be there, that is, the
outgoing Members of Parliament would
be there. And according to the
Constitution, the Speaker is to be elected
by Members of Parliament; the
Constitution did not specify whether it
should be the new Members, to borrow
your Words - [Interruption] - please,
we have not got there. It is about
"Election of the Speaker" -
[Interruption] --No, article 100 is talking
about - Mr Speaker, what we are looking
at now is the election of -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker:
Article -- 100 (2) -
"A Member of Parliament may,
before taking the oaths referred to
~ in clause (1) of this article, take part
in the election of the Speaker."
Hon Member, you may continue.
Mr J. B. Aidoo: Yes, Mr Speaker,
agreed; but the point is that, who can take
part? What about the old Members?
Clause 95 is not very clear and my point is
that we should have the dissolution of
the existing Parliament firstt before we can
proceed to have another Parliament.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker:Very well.
Hon Members, the proposition is that,
no matter what happens, the dissolution
must take place before other Members
come to elect the Speaker. Assuming, Hon
Members- let us address our minds to
this; just for the sake of argument, there
is what you may call an outgoing Member
but who is also an elected. Member of
Parliament who insists that nothing debars
him from taking part in the vote by the
Constitution, even as per article 100 (1)
and (2).

So for certain purposes, we are
constituting the Parliament for the next
Government. I do not think there should
be a problem. If we say Members of
Parliament who have been elected to take
office on 7"‘ January, 2013 are to meet to
take certain decisions, how can someone
who is not a Member of that Parliament
say he is a Member of Parliament? Yes,
technically he/she is a Member of
Parliament; but not a Member of
Parliament of that Parliament.
I do not think it creates any legal
problem at all, particularly when we all
understand that we want to tidy up the
transition. So in my view, you know, there
can only be one Parliament and it must be
constituted by a certain number of
Members. We can have an incumbent and
an elected -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Papa-
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: So I do not
have a proposal. All I am saying is that
the arguments that we are advancing,
given the impression that there is going
to be a difficulty, we have to hope for the
dissolution of that Parliament, is not
something that practically arises.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker:Very well.
Thank you very much, Hon Papa Owusu-
Ankomah.
Alhaji Abukari Sumani: Mr Speaker,
we would be grateful if the former
Attorney-General and Minister for Justice
can help us with a definition of who is a
Member of Parliament? When does he
become Member of Parliament, and when
does his tenure end? We would be very
grateful.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Yes, Hon
Chairman of the Committee - in fact, you
have made a statement --
Alhaji Abukari: It is not a statement;
it is very important.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: It is a
question loaded with a statement.
Alhaji Sumani: We ought to clear our
minds when the Constitution talks about
a Member of Parliament; that will tell us
what the Constitution means by a
"Member of Parliament".
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Mr Speaker,
if you are asking me about the Members
of the Fifth Parliament of the Republic of
Ghana, I will say that they are the Members
who Will be elected after the general
election of 2012. That is all I can say. It
becomes effective on the day when they
assume office -- yes -- when they
assume office. You can decide to swear;
in someone to take effect in three weeks;
is there anything wrong with that?
Mr Bandua -rose-
Mr Felix Twumasi-Appiah: Mr
Speaker, I think the difficulty here has to
do with 48 hours before the 7th January
swearing-in of the Speaker.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Chairman
of the Committee, you would come in later.
Hon Chairman, you are listening to them
and your views will be very instructive at
the latter point. 
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: As Hon Papa
said, if the difficulty is that we want to
improve on the earlier arrangement, We can
have Parliament mid-night as usual, and
have the new Members of Parliament
sworn-in, let us say at 1.00 a.m.; have all
these arrangements in place before the 8
o’clock that my Hon good Friend was
suggesting.

But we should not forget that
somewhere within the Fourth Republican
Parliament, I have cases where, I think the
then Minority Leader, Hon J. H. Mensah
raised the issue about the place to swear
in the Speaker. He was insisting that it
must be done on the floor of the House,
not under a certain tree, or under a certain
canopy or on some other park somewhere.
He wanted it to be done on the floor of
the House.
Taking that in mind, I think that we can
have Parliament dissolved mid-night 6th
January, have the Members of Parliament-
elect sworn-in one minute after mid-night,
if they so wish and then we carry on from
there and elect a Speaker, by which way,
we would have more time to let the
President in and also have the President
sworn-in.
So I think we want to improve upon
the earlier arrangement and this is what I
propose.
Thank you very much.
Dr A. A. Osei - rose -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: That
would be very tidy.
Hon Dr Akoto Osei, you would wait a
while.
Hon Member- I want us to spread
the contribution as much as possible.
Mr Simon Osei-Mensah:Mr Speaker,
considering the importance of this
particular Bill and the amendments we
want to make, I wish we could suspend
debate or discussion on the Bill, so that
people can go back, read and reflect and
then we organize a Committee of the
Whole to discuss other welfare matters.
I think we need to suspend the debate
now and then consider other serious
Business of the House.
1.O0 p.m.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: This is a
House of debate and debate will continue.
Mr Bandua: Mr Speaker, l think that I
share the sentiments of the Hon Member
for Sekondi (Papa Owusu-Ankomah). The
only problem that is arising is whether or
not the Members of Parliament- elect have
the capacity to take the election of the
Speaker before they are sworn in, and that
defect has been cured by article 102. So I
do not see any problem. There is no
problem.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, in fact, this is the only way
some of these important matters may be
addressed, is the way Hon Members are
doing now. This is the only way some of
these important matters can be discussed.
It is not a matter of some winnowing.
Those matters are different and in fact,
this is a very important debate that will
reflect in the Hansard for posterity.
Hon Yieleh Chireh, you will continue.
Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, I have looked
at article 95 and if you read article 95 (1)
very closely, it says:
"There shall be a Speaker of
Parliament who shall be elected by
the Members of Parliament from
among persons who are Members
of Parliament or who are qualified
to be elected as Members of
Parliament."
With this, the issue in this Bill that it
is trying to resolve is that, 48 hours or
two days before the President is sworn
in, you convene Members of Parliament-
elect to come and elect a Speaker. It is
possible and it is practicable. Now,
Members of Parliament-elect will elect
the Speaker 48 hours to -- now the old
Parliament is not dissolved --
[Interruption] Wait, I am coming to
the point. The old Parliament --
[Interruption]

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: On a point of
order.
Mr Speaker, if I may remind my good
Friend, 48 hours before the last Parliament
was dissolved, it was Sitting. I remember
very well; we were on the floor of this
House -still considering Bills and other
activities. We were still Sitting. Where
are they going to elect that Speaker? I
have already made reference to the fact
that in the last Parliament, Hon J. H.
Mensah raised an issue about even Where
to swear-in the President -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Yieleh Chireh, you will assume your seat
for the time being.
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: Even where to
swear-in the President and the Speaker,
he disagreed. I think even"that matter
almost went to court. He disagreed with
where to swear-in the President, whether
it should be at the lndependence Square,
whether it should be under a tree
somewhere, whether it should be in a
classroom somewhere. His argument was
that the President and the Speaker must
be sworn-in before Parliament on the floor
of the House. On 4th January as of. Last
three years, Parliament was still in
Session. '
Even on 6th January, the last Parliament
was still in Session.We had to come here,
close, go back home around 5.00 p.m. and
come back for dissolution. I think, like
Hon Papa Owusu-Ankomah said, if we
want to improve on the existing
arrangement, what we need to do is that,
as soon as Parliament is dissolved
midnight, the incoming Parliament can
then takeover, do all their behind the scene
arrangements, have the Speaker sworn-
in, they themselves sworn-in and then
wait for the Presidential swearing-in. I
think that should be the better arrangement
that we can have as a House.
Mr Avoka -- rose -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon_
Majority Leader, do you have a point of
order?
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, after Hon Yieleh
Chireh, with your kind indulgence---
Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, you can see
that I was not yielding - 
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, if you want to take your
precedence, you take it now.
Mr Chireh: Mr Speaker, then it means
that -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, I have called you. You
were on your feet and I recognised you}
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, the combined
effect of article 95 (4) and 100 (2) is this,
simple:
"Members of Parliament-elect can
elect the Speaker before they are
sworn-in as Members of
Parliament."
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: That is
true and all Hon Members have no doubt
about that. It is not the issue.
Mr Avoka: Yes. That being so, two
days before the dissolution of Parliament,‘
Members of Parliament-elect who have
not yet been sworn-in can meet anywhere
in the country and elect the Speaker of
Parliament. The Constitution provides
that.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Any
Where in the country?
Mr Avoka: Yes, I mean the laws are
there. We can meet at the International
Conference Centre; we can meet here
during the day -

Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader --- _
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, the point is
not the venue. I am talking about the
principle." The point is not the venue. We
should not capitalise on the venue and
digress. I am saying that two days before
Parliament is dissolved, while we have
Members of Parliament-elect, the
Constitution empowers them to elect a
Speaker before they are sworn-in. They
are sworn-in under article 100. But the
Constitution says that before they are
even sworn-in -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I will
always think that Hon Members must meet
in this House, not meet anywhere and
elect a Speaker. The Hon Majority Leader
was leading us into temptation.
Mr Emmanuel A. Owusu-Ansah: On a
point of order.
Mr Speaker, the Hon Majority Leader
is speaking as though in this country the
Constitution creates two Speakers at the
same time. The Constitution creates one
Speaker at one time. When one Parliament
exits and another one comes into being,
the new one elects its own Speaker and
he/she is sworn-in. -
So if we go by his postulation that we
should have a Speaker sworn-in two or
three days before the end of the exiting
Speaker, then What will be the situation of
the Speaker that has been sworn-in?
What will be his function? What will be
his status in Parliament? We can have
one Speaker at one time.
So as Hon Papa Owusu-Ankomah said,
there is always a lacuna at 12 midnight on
6th January. One Parliament leaves office,
the other Parliament comes into being the
next day when a Speaker has been sworn
into office and the Speaker has also in turn
sworn-in Members of Parliament into
office.
Mr Speaker, my position is that, we
cannot go by the Majority Leader’s
position. It will create unnecessary
trouble for us.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I think
there should be less of points of order as
possible, so that there will be
contributions and of course, Leaders in
particular will have all the contributions
they want to make.
Hon Minority "Leader, if you want to
speak, you may have to negotiate with
the Hon Majority Leader.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
it is just a point of information and I believe
Hon Members would advert their minds
to article 106 (11) -- Parliament has the
powers to postpone the operation of a law
that we make. We do have the power so
to do. Parliament by article 106 (11), we
have the inherent power in making a law
to determine the effective operation of
that law. So we do not need to meet at
midnight as people have been labouring
to establish. So Mr Speaker, they do not
have to travel that path at all. It is as
crystal clear as daylight. V
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, if I may
continue.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Yes, Hon
Majority Leader, you can continue.
MrAv0ka: Mr Speaker, if you look
at article 95 (4), it addresses the issue that
Hon Owusu-Ansah was trying to draw
attention to. Article 95 (4) says:
"A person elected to the office of
Speaker shall, before entering up on
the duties of his office, take and
subscribe before Parliament the
oath of allegiance and the Speaker's
oath set out in the ..." -

So if we meet as Hon Members of
Parliament without even taking an oath
as Such, we can elect a Speaker. We under
article 95(4) - So it is not automatic that
when we elect a Speaker, he-or she will
start duty the same day or the following
day. No.
1.10p.m.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, that is not part of the
argument anyway.
Mr Twumasi-Appiah: Mr Speaker, I
think the fundamental point we are making
here is that, what will be wrong as per the
Minority Leader’s argument, what will be
wrong if we wait for the incumbent
Parliament to be dissolved before we go
in and elect it; what will be wrong? All we
are saying is that we think the Speaker
should be selected or elected on the floor
of this House and I did give an example
that the last Parliament as of 5th January,
before the midnight dissolution,
Parliament was still in Session.
So where are they going to Sit to elect
this new Parliament? Where the incumbent
Parliament is Sitting? Hon J. H. Mensah
raised this issue about the venue. I think
that was in 19 - [Interruption]
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order! 
Mr Kwabena O. Darko-Mensah:
Mr Speaker, we just want to solve a
problem and we should be clear about
time lines- [Interruption]
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Order!
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, I have
information that last Friday, unfortunately,
I was not here, there was a desire on the
part of Hon Colleagues for us to have a
joint caucus meeting. I have no objection.
We can have the meeting as soon as We
close for some few minutes and then
discuss some matters and then see how
we can resolve them.
So, for the information of everyone of
us, as soon as we adjourn, we can remain
in the Chamber and have some few
minutes discussion for the benefit of all
I beg to move, subject to that
announcement, Mr Speaker.
Mr Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr
Speaker, I made a suggestion to my
Colleague the Majority Leader and the
Attorney-General and Minister for
Justice, in respect of the Presidential
Transition Bill that is before us. I would
plead that the Majority Leader follows
through the suggestion diligently. It will
save us this forwards and backwards
movement. 
Mr Speaker, the suggestion that I
proffered, was to the effect that we find
ourselves on a very constricted path and
that is what is yielding before us the
Presidential Transition Bill. Mr Speaker, I
had suggested to the Attorney-General
and the Majority Leader, that we should
endeavour to capture the language
relating to the presidential election as
expressed in the Constitution, which is
that the presidential election could be held
anytime between September 6th and
December 7th. In respect of the general
elections relating to Members of
Parliament, we only have December 7th.
Mr Speaker, if we amended that portion
of the Constitution to capture the
expression with respect to the holding of
the presidential election, we will be home
and dry rather than imposing on ourselves
48 hours before this, 24 hours before that
- Mr Speaker, let us do that. Once you do
that, even when we have the Transition
Bill, it is not an entrenched provision. It
is not. It is not an entrenched provision;
we can go back and quickly do that and
once we do that, we will be home and dry.
Mr Speaker, that is where the problem
is; it is the kernel of this matter; let us go
and address it. Let us go and address it
and itiwould resolve this whole problem
for us.
Having said that, Mr Speaker, I beg to
second the Motion moved by the Majority
Leader -
Mr Avoka - rose -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Minority Leader, you may continue.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: I would want
to second the Motion moved by the
Maj ority Leader for adjournment to enable
us move into a caucus of the Whole
Meeting. Mr Speaker, I believe the events
that will unfold, the discussions that we
hold, would determine how many minutes
and hours that meeting should last.
I would want to resist the temptation
by the Majority Leader that we will only
meet for a few minutes. It may not be for
a few minutes, Let us move into a meeting
and the circumstances will determine how
long the meeting will last.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
Motion for adjournment has been moved
and seconded. ,
Question put and Motion agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT
The House was accordingly
adjourned at 1.20-p.m.till Wednesday, 15th
February, 2012 at 10.00 a.m.
