[MS BOATENG] .
I may quote Madam Speaker ---"May I
know when, given time"-I mean giving
the time when this will be completed. The
word ‘the’ is omitted and then the ‘giving’
is wrongly spelt. So I want that to be
corrected. 
Madam Speaker: Yes, ‘I know when’,
yes, what is the correction?
Ms Boateng: Madam Speaker, I asked
that he should ‘ give me the time’ - giving
the time when this will be completed.
Madam Speaker: ‘Giving’ not ‘given’ -
What is the correction?
Ms Boateng: Madam Speaker, I said I
wanted the Hon Minister to give me the
time that the others will be completed and
it has been stated as ‘given’ time and it is
not clear in my mind, Madam Speaker.
Madam Speaker: Yes, so how will we
put it‘?
Miss Boateng: It should be "giving the
time".
10.50 am. 
Madam Speaker: Any other
corrections? 
Hon Members, the Official Report of
Wednesday, 26th October, 2011 as
corrected represents the true record of
proceedings.
Item 3 - Business Statement for the
week .
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE
Majoritg Leader/Chairman of the
Business ommittee (Mr Cletus A.
Avoka): Madam Speaker, the Committee
met on Thursday, 7th October 2011 and
arransged the Business of the House for
the second Week ending Friday, 4th
November, 2011.
Madam Spbeaker, the Committee
accordingly submitsts its report as follows?
Arrangement of Business
Questi0n(s)
Madam Speaker the Committee has
programmed the following Ministers to
answer Questions asked fo them during
the Week: '
No. of
Question(s)
i. Minister of State responsible for the Scholarship Secretariat - 1
ii. Minister for information-3
iii. Minister for the Interior-6
iv. Minister for Water Resources, Works and Housing - 6
v. Minister for Food and Agriculture-1
vi. Minister for Roads and Highways-7
Total Number of Questions- 24.
Madam Speaker, in all, six Ministers are
expected to attend upon the House to
respond to twenty-four (24) Questions
during the week. The Questions are of the
following types: 
i.Urgent - 3
ii. Oral - 20
iii. Written - 1
Madam Speaker, it is important that we
actually endeavour to have this Question
time placed during the course of the whole
Meeting because one, with the impending
Budget that we would be having in the
middle of November, we may not be able
to deal with many Questions at the same
time with the Budget process. So it is
important that we address the backlog of
Questions now. 
Consequently, I want to take this
opportunity to appeal to Hon Colleagues
who have put down these Questions to
attend to the Chamber and ensure that
these Questions are asked of the
Ministers to the best of their ability. In
the same vein, it is important that Hon
Ministers of State -who have been
programmed to appear before the House
to answer Questions would do so because
if we default, we will find it difficult to re-
programme these things. So it is
incumbent upon both Hon Members and
Ministers of State to ensure that the
Question time is dealt With.
Statements -
Madam Speaker may allow Statements
duly admitted to be made in the House.
Bills, Papers and Reports ,
Madam Speaker, Bills may be presented
to the House for consideration and those
already before the House may be taken
through the various stages. Papers and
Committee Reports may also be presented
to the House.

Madam Speaker, Motions may be
debated and their consequential
Resolutions, if any, taken during the week.
Closed Sitting of the House
Madam Speaker, the Business
Committee proposes a Closed Sitting of
the House to be held preferably on
Thursday, 3rd November, 2011.
All Hon Members are accordingly
urged to avail themselves for fruitful
deliberations at the said Closed Sitting.
Conclusion
Madam Speaker, in accordance with
Standing Order 160(2) and subject to
Standing Order 53, the Committee submits
to this Honourable House the order in
which the Business of the House shall be
taken during the week.

Friday, 28th October, 2011
The House met at 10.30 a.m. .
[MADAM SPEAKER IN THE chair]
PRAYERS
Votes and Proceedings and the
Official Report
Madam Speaker: Hon Members, item
2. Correction of Votes and Proceedings
of Thursday, 27th October, 2011
Page 1. . . . 2 -
Mr Frederick Opare-Ansah: Madam
Speaker, if you look at the numbering of
the attendance, you would notice it is a
whole new numbering system, so, I urge
the Table Oftice to take note and correct it
accordingly. You are either (1) or anumber
between (1) and (8). [Interruption] I did
not say page, I said the entire attendance
of Hon Members who were present. You
are either (1) or any number between (1)
to (8) and (9).
Madam Speaker: You are saying that
we do not have one-third; is it? Is that
what you are saying? Can you speak into
the microphone? -
Mr Opare-Ansah: Madam Speaker,
from pages 1 through 4 -- 
Madam Speaker: Pages 1 to 4--
Mr Opare-Ansah: Madam Speaker, if
you look at the column Hon Members
present, instead of being numbered from
(1) up to the total number that was
present, on page 4, for instance,
everybody is numbered (1)- On page 3,
you are either numbered 1, 9, 7 or 8. A
Madam Speaker: Yes -- _ .
Mr Opare-Ansah: Luxury numbers?
Madam Speaker, I am told they are luxury
numbers. . -
Madam Speaker: Yes, thank you. So,
you want it corrected with the proper
numbering? Yes, that will be done.
We got to page 2, is it not? So, pages
2, 3 and 4 have been corrected.
Pages 5. . .7-
Mr Ambrose P. Dery: Madam Speaker,
at page 7, item 10 - MOTlON- under it
we have that the Data Protection Bill, 2011,
be now read "a Second time"; it was
moved by the Hon Minister for
Communications. There is no indication
that it was seconded. I believe that the
Chairman probably seconded the Motion
because if it was not seconded, it could
not have appeared in the Votes and
Proceedings so I believe it was seconded.
If it was, then it should be corrected to
show that it was seconded. What is there
shows that the Hon Chairman of the
Committee, Mr Felix Twumasi Appiah
presented the Report but I thought that
he would have seconded it and after doing
so presented the Report.
Mr Joseph Yieleh Chireh - rose--
Madam Speaker: Hon Member, are you
going to make a contribution? That is all
right. So, is there anybody denying that
it was seconded so that it would be
corrected as seconded?
Mr Opare-Ansah: Madam Speaker, it
Was seconded but the record did not
reflect the secondment. It was seconded
by Hon Felix Twumasi-Appiah.
Madam Speaker: Thank you. That it
is a correction that should appear.
Did we get to page 8?
Page 8 . . .l6--[Pause.]
Hon-Members, the Votes and
Proceedings for Thursday, 27th of-
October, 2011 as corrected is hereby
adopted as the true record of proceedings.
Let us move to the Offiicial Report -
two Official Reports to be corrected--
Tuesday, 25th November, 2011, any
corrections in that Official Report?
Hon Members, in the absence of any
corrections, the Official Report of
Tuesday, 25th October, 2011 is hereby
adopted as the true record of proceedings.
10.4.0 a.m.
Mr Chireh: Madam Speaker, I am sorry
to take you back, on the 25th October, 2011
Official Report. Columns 93 and 94, are
blank, I do not know whether it is the same"
thing with the others. "
Madam Speaker: No, I do not have a
blank page - Columns 93 and 94. So I
think that was an error. In my copy, there
is no blank page. Hon Dr Osei, do you
have a blank page? I am referring you to
the Tuesday, 25th October, 2011.
Do you have a blank page? So shall
we take it that it is there?
In the absence of any correction, I have
already said the Official Report of
Tuesday, 25th October, 2011 is hereby
adopted as the record of proceedings.
Shall We move to the Official Report
of Wednesday, 26th October, 2011.
Any corrections?
Dr Anthony A. Osei: Madam Speaker,
column 117, the 5th paragraph the last but
one line, the word "Tapase". should be
"Tapass". '
Madam Speaker, the last but one line
under my Statement; the spelling should
be "T-a-p-a-s-s".
Madam Speaker: Are you referring to
the Wednesday, 26th October, 2011?
DrA. A. Osei: That is correct. Column
117 under my name. _ _
Madam Speaker: My copy ends with
170. [Pause]. I think we will suspend
correction because my copy ends with
Column 170, but you are referring to -
Dr A. A. Osei: Column 117.
Madam Speaker: All right. i
Dr A. A. Osei: The last but one line of
my Statement. The spelling should be
Tapass, not Tapase.
Madam Speaker: Column 117 and you
are referring to the last but one -
Dr A. A. Osei: The name "Tapase"
should be ‘Tapass’.
Madam Speaker: Thanks for the
correction. Any other corrections.
Dr Ahmed Yakubu Alhassan: Madam
Speaker, column 163, the last paragraph,
the last sentence, it should read,
"This is because climate change and
its associated weather extremes are
no more a concept but a real threat
that ‘human kind’ has to contend
with" not " ‘the human mind’ has to
contend With".
Madam Speaker: "Human kind"--
Dr Alhassan: Yes.
Madam Speaker: Thank you.

Madam Speaker: Thank you. 
Any comments?
Papa Owusu-Ank0mah: Madam
Speaker, this is in respect-of item 3 of the
explanatory memorandum. Madam
Speaker, it is my view that this is not an
item that should appear as part of the
Business of the House because a Closed
Sitting is part of the formal business of
the House. In this respect, with your
leave, I would refer to Order 44 of the
Standing Orders.
Madam Speaker, Standing Order 44 (1)
states:
"Mr Speaker may in consultation
with the House and having regard
to public interest order the House
to move into Closed Sitting to
discuss a particular subject or for
the remainder of the Sitting."
Madam Speaker, from the explanation
given by the Hon Majority Leader and
Chairman of the Business Committee, it is
supposed to be a meeting by Members of
Parliament to discuss matters affecting
themselves, not matters affecting the
nation or as an item of business. So, he
could have stated that well, probably, after
adjournment, Members would meet to
discuss in-house matters.
It should not appear as a Closed Sitting
and I am constrained to say this because
it seems as if this is what has been
described overtime -- every time Closed
Sitting. A Closed Sitting is part of the
business of the House and it is presided
over by Madam Speaker. It is not any
meeting of Members of Parliament after
adjournment as he said that is a Closed
Sitting. "
So, I just want the Chairman of the
Business Committee to take note.
Madam Speaker: Well, I suppose,
especially, when it talks about and
discusses welfare matters.
"Leader, I think the proper procedure -
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Madam
Speaker, having said this, I beg to move,
that this explanatory memorandum be
amended by deleting item 3. _
Madam Speaker: We are deleting item
5? You mean we should delete item 5 --
Item 3 is Questions. You mean the
Questions should be deleted?
Mr Dery: No. Madam Speaker, the
first page-item 3 "Closed Sitting of the
House."
Madam Speaker: All right.
Any objections to that?
Mr Dery: Madam Speaker, I do not
think so. I think it is technically a sound
point and I second the Motion.
Madam Speaker: So consequentially,
the list at page 3, item (v), should be
deleted.
Any other comments?
11.00 am.
Mr Yaw Owusu-Boateng: Madam
Speaker, I have gone through the Business
Statement and I have found out that still
the Hon Minister for finance and
Economic Planning is not coming to
answer Questions. I have already said
this time and again, that it is almost two
years that we have had the Hon Minister
for finance and Economic Planning come
to the House to answer Hon Members’
Questions.
When we were going on recess, he was
programmed for this House this week.
Now, it has shifted again and throughout
the upcoming week, we are not going to
have the Hon Minister for finance and
Economic Planning coming onto the floor
to answer Questions. It is something that
baffles me. What is happening?
Mr Avoka: Madam Speaker, the Hon
Minister for finance and Economic
Planning does not prepare the Business
of this House. If the Hon Member has
filed some Questions relating to the Hon
Minister for finance and Economic
Planning, he can indicate that he has some
outstanding Questions in relation to the
Hon Minister for finance and Economic
Planning and urge the Business Committee
to programme the Hon Minister for
finance and Economic Planning.
But to get up and blame the Hon
Minister for finance and Economic
Planning when he did not prepare this
Business Statement, I think it is misplaced;
it is entirely misplaced. This is because if
the Hon Minister for finance and
Economic Planning had been programmed
here and he had not been coming, then,
the Hon Member could say that, "Look,
Madam Speaker, the Hon Minister for
finance and Economic Planning is
supposed to appear on this particular day
but having regard to previous experience,
we want to ensure that he comes to answer
the Questions."
But for the whole of the week, the Hon
Minister for finance and Economic
Planning has not been programmed. So
why is he a subject matter of discussion?
It is misplaced.
Mr Dery: Madam Speaker, the Hon
Majority Leader is adding to what the Hon
Member has said.. He has stated a fact,
that the Hon Minister for finance and
Economic Planning does not come to
answer Questions. He has raised this issue
before the last Meeting. He is not
blaming the Hon Minister for finance and
Economic Planning for failing to turn up
when he is programmed; so I think that
we as Hon Members of the Business
Committee should take note of that and
go and look at the Questions and see what
we do. He is not blaming the Hon Minister
for finance and Economic Planning as a
person, for not coming, but he has raised
an issue. - -
Madam Speaker, we have not
programmed the Hon Minister for finance
and Economic Planning; we have not and
that is an very important Ministry, and if
there are Questions that are pending, our
oversight would come to nought if we do
not invite him.
All I would say is that, we as Hon
Members of the Business Committee
should take note, of the issue that has
been raised by the Hon Member and look
at it further, rather than taking him on as
an individual- He is not blaming the Hon
Minister for finance and Economic
Planning.
Mr Avoka: Madam Speaker, my very
good Friend, the Hon Deputy Minority
Leader is defending theindefensible. I
am saying that, if we had programmed the
Hon Minister for finance and Economic
Planning on this Business Statement,
then he is right to draw our attention to
the fact that the Hon Minister for finance
and Economic Planning has been
defaulting, therefore we should make sure
that he comes this time.
But the Hon Minister for finance and
Economic Planning has not been
programmed for next week, so what is the
basis for raising the issue concerning the
Hon Minister for finance and Economic
Planning? It is misplaced; it is premature
and that is what I am saying.
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Madam
Speaker, I am urging the Leader of
Government Business to take these
matters to heart because the fact is that
what the Hon Member said was that, the
Hon Minister for finance and Economic
Planning was scheduled to appear before
this House before we rose as the proposed
Business for the first Week and he had
observed that he was not scheduled this
week, neither was he scheduled for next
week and we all know that the Hon
Minister for finance and Economic
Planning, probably, may be engaged
somewhere. He said the whole of last two
weeks. 
We cannot continue blaming the
Business Committee. The blame rests with
the Hon Minister for finance and
Economic Planning. It cannot be the
Business Committee because We all know
that the Business Committee would
schedule certain Hon Ministers, and for
some reason, on the scheduled date, an
excuse would be proffered. It is
unacceptable and every Hon Member has
every right to raise this matter on the floor
of the House for the House to take a
decision.
It cannot be that the Business
Committee would take responsibility for
everything. If the Business Committee
is to take responsibility, we can then say
that we are rejecting the Business
Statement; they should go and schedule
the Hon Minister; then we can reject it.
I am urging the Hon Majority Leader
and the Leader of Government Business
to accept this.
It is true that the Hon Minister for
finance and Economic Planning has not
been appearing. The Hon Member has
commented on it previously, and today
he is reiterating the point and he has a
right so to do. The Hon Majority Leader
should take note of it. When was the last
time the Hon Minister for finance and
Economic Planning appeared before the
House?
I am urging all Hon Members of the
Business Committee, particularly those
representing the Minority, the Leadership,
to take these matters up when it comes to
the Business Committee, and when the
matters are raised, they should let it be
noted in the Explanatory Memorandum so
that we know that the Business Committee
is really doing its job.
Some Hon Members - rose -
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: If Hon
Members may sit. I do not to think they
are rising on a point of order. They want
to contribute. I am not usurping Madam
Speaker’s position.
The Hon Minister for Health, he has
been resuscitated, he should take it easy.
At the appropriate time, he would have
his contribution. That isthe purpose ofthis
House- oversight-- and we do not have
to always say that, "Yes, at the will and
pleasure of everybody..."
The Business Committee should be up
and doing and the Leader of Government
Business should also be up and doing, but
not to raise issues as if the Hon Member
had no point in bringing this matter before
the House.
Madam Speaker: Thank you, Hon
Member. 
Mr Joseph Y. Chireh: Madam Speaker,
I think that the Hon Leader has addressed
the issue sufficiently. That first and
foremost, Hon Ministers do not decide
when they come and answer Questions.
It is the Business Committee. If he got up
and talked as he is doing now, that the
Business Committee has not done its
work, we would have to blame the
Business Committee, but not to call the
Hon Minister for finance and Economic
Planning and say that he has never
appeared here. What occasioned what
he is saying, and making it look like the
Hon Minister is running away from -
The Hon Minister comes here to
presenta Budget Statement and they
know that later on in this Meeting, he
would come and present the Budget. He
should be preparing; he must be busy.
Apart from that, we have on record here
that Hon Ministers who are scheduled
could also be represented by the Deputy
Ministers. They are supposed to provide
facts and answers to the Questions -
[Interruptions] 
Madam Speaker: Order! 
Mr Chireh: It is not the personality
of the person, so it is not fair that he says
that the Hon Minister has never appeared
here. What was the occasion for him to
have appeared here? I think that we must
legitimately raise issues that are correct.
We can programme the Hon Minister
and he would be here. Why? Is he afraid
to answer Questions? No Hon Minister
is afraid to come and answer Questions
here. 
Prof. Aaron M. Oquaye: Madam
Speaker, I was only going to assist my
Hon Friend on the other side to save his
breath. There is only one thing that is
very, very important in this very matter.
when we have it resolved, we have no
problem.
The matter had already been
scheduled. The Question had been
scheduled before we rose and that matter
should be addressed by the Hon Majority
Leader. And the moment he addresses
that, then he has no problem.
Madam Speaker: Yes, Hon Members,
can I come in? I think I have heard enough.
Today, we have the record; he has not
been scheduled. The Hon Minister has
not been scheduled. If today the Hon
Minister had been scheduled, then we
would even impress upon him that he
should come.
But if we are talking about this
Statement of the Second Week ending 4th
Friday which We are, if it is meant to alert
the Business Committee that when he is
listed, he should endeavour _to come or
that the last time he was listed, so they
should try and list him as quickly as
possible, that would be a legitimate
concern. But on this Paper, what I see is
that he is not scheduled so -- Is it the
idea that - 
Mr Dery: No, no. Madam Speaker, I
totally agree. I respect the rule. I am only
drawing the Hon Leader’s attention-
Who is the Chairman of the Committee that
I also belong to, that there is an allegation
that before we rose we scheduled; that is
the allegation. So I said that we should
take note of it and investigate it.
[Interruption] That was what he said
before - No, he is _not referring to this.
He said before we rose -. [Interrupti0n.]
11.10 am.
Madam Speaker: Order! Ithink that
the Hon Member was referring to the fact
that, he was scheduled last time but he is
not on this list. So I think all you can
assure us is that, you will schedule him as
quickly as possible to come. That is the
only answer that you can give.
Hon Leader, if the complaint is that he
was scheduled last term and they
expected that in the first week he would
be scheduled, can you assure us that he
would be coming as quickly as he can?
This is because I think the complaint is
that, the Question has been long
outstanding. Is that not it? 
Mr Avoka: Madam Speaker, once you
have given a direction, I do not think we
need to belabour the point. But when I
was reading the Business Statement, I
indicated, that in view of the tight
programme that we have, particularly with
the Budget, all Hon Ministers who have
been scheduled to appear before us must
endeavour to do so. I said that. 
I also indicated that Hon Members who
have asked those Questions should also
be available in the Chamber so that they
can prosecute that. I said that; this takes
care of my Hon Colleague’s interest if the
Minister for finance and Economic
Planning had not been coming.. 
But I am saying that, if the Hon
Minister has not been scheduled for next
week and he is a subject matter of
discussion, that he defaulted during that
last Sitting - if the Hon Minister has been
scheduled for next week and you raise this
issue about the Hon Minister for finance
and Economic Planning - then it is in
place. But he has not been scheduled and
you are accusing the Minister, I do not
think it is fair. -
This is because the Hon Minister has
come here several times, before we rose,
he presented a Supplementary Budget and
did everything. I think that allegation or
accusation is misplaced and I abide by
your ruling.
Mr Sampson Ahi -- rose -
Madam Speaker: Are you going to
help us with this one? 
Mr Ahi: Madam Speaker, I believe if
we are to blame anybody at all; it is the
Business Committee that we have to
blame. They have refused to do what is
expected of them.
The Minister for finance and Economic
Planning was scheduled to appear before
the House at the last Sitting. That does
not mean that when we resume Sitting, he
will automatically come here and answer
those Questions. The Business
Committee is supposed to invite the
Minister for finance and Economic
Planning officially.
So if by this Business Statement, the
Minister for finance and Economic
Planning has not been scheduled to
appear here, then nobody should blame
the Minister for finance and Economic
Planning, that he his running away from
attending upon the Business of the
House. If we have to blame anybody at
all, it is the Business Committee which is
not only the Majority-- both Majority
and Minority members on the Business
Committee are to blame. 
Madam Speaker: Yes, I think this boils
down to the fact that, Hon Leader, they
want a Question which is pending to be
scheduled for answering as quickly as
possible; that is the real point of the matter
and for which they require the Hon
Minister to appear and answer. So, I
suppose if you take note of this, we will
be able to move on. 
So Hon Chairman of the Business
Committee, take note.
Any other matter before we adopt the
Business Statement of the week as
discussed?
Hon Members, as discussed, the
Business Statement as presented is
adopted. I do not think we amended it.--
Mr Dery: Madam Speaker, as
amended; we amended the Closed Sitting.
Madam Speaker: Oh, yes, as amended,
I thank you -- as amended by deleting
item 3. 
Shall we move to item 4 -- Leader, I
thought there was going to be a
Statement? -
MrAvoka: Yes, Madam Speaker, upon
further consultation with the Minister for
Health, who was inthe Chamber, we have
decided to defer this one and then
investigate to find out whether as a fact
there is something like that in place and
then they can make an informed statement
on the subject.
Thank you.
Madam Speaker: Then we go to the
Commencement of Public Business, item 5 --
Leader, I think items 5, 6, 7 and 8, are they
coming?
Mr Avoka: We respectfully defer items
5, 6, 7 and 8. It is only items 9 that will be
left. -
Madam Speaker: So we shouldmove
to item 9?
MrAvoka: That is so.
Madam Speaker: I think today we will
have time to do a lot of work on item 9. In
which case, I think, Leader, if you want a
meeting, you need to inform the House or
are we to take it that you are already
informed about a meeting that will take
place, that is the House Committee’s
meeting. Do you want to say anything
on that matter? Do you inform Hon
Members then that you are going to hold
a House Committee meeting after the
Sitting?
Mr Avoka: I just want to intimate that
following the amendment on the Business
Statement, there will still be a Sitting after
adjournment on Thursday.
Thank you.
Madam Speaker: Thank you, Hon
Leader. 
Item 8 will be taken by the Second
Deputy Speaker who is on his way here.
Item 9 - [Pause]
Dr A. Osei: Madam. Speaker, under
normal circumstances, when We are
considering such a Bill, we will expect that
at least one'Hon Minister from that
particular Ministry would be available
should we need his or her input. I look
around; I do not see any Minister from
the Ministry of Energy available to
sponsor a Bill that they deem important. I
think it is an affront to the dignity of this
House that we have an absence - I do
not think that Members of Parliament
should be treated with such contempt.
I appeal to the Majority Leader to have
a word with the Ministry, that on Friday
when we had very important things to do
and we are going to read their Bill, they
would not even bother to honour us with
their presence which suggests that the Bill
may not be important and I want to move
that the House adjourn.-
11.20 am.
Madam Speaker: I thought this is
rather premature since we have not
reached item 9 yet. So if you will allow the
Second Deputy Speaker to take the Chair,
it will be a proper time to raise this matter.
I thank you. 
11.20 am. -- 
[MR SECOND DEPUTY SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR] _
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Members, item 9 - Renewable Energy
Bill, 2011 at the Consideration Stage.
BILLS -- CONSIDERATION STAGE
Renewable Energy Bill, 2011
[Resumption of Debate from 2 7-] 0-]]]
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, yesterday, on
clause 27 -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Start so
that- I hear there is some difficulty -
Mr Asaga: What is the question?
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Clause
27, there is an amendment in the name of
the Chairman of the Committee.
Mr Asaga: Yes, and that is what I am
exactly doing. _
Mr Speaker, I beg to move, clause 27,
subclause (1), delete and insert the
following: '
"An electricity distribution utility
shall not buy or negotiate a Power
Purchase Agreement with a
generator of electricity from
renewable energy sources without
the written approval of the Public
Utilities Regulatory Commission."
So this is the amendment and yesterday
we had discussions on it. But even
though I have been dialoguing with the
Minority Chief Whip, I still feel convinced
that we should maintain it as it is. This is
because the new information that I have
got -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Chairman of the Committee, if the two of
you are not ad idem, we will proceed and
then later on, you put your heads together
gently, and come to some conclusion
because we want'to make progress.
Dr A. Osei: Mr Speaker, right before
you asstuned the Chair, Madam Speaker
said I was premature with the point I was
raising.
The point is that, we are looking at the
Consideration Stage of a Bill for which the
sector Minister is not even available. I
think it is a very serious omission and one
that we should not seek to move forward.
This is because if there is some issue that
‘requires policy direction, we will not be
helping ourselves. Passing a Bill for which
the sector Minister is not here may lead
us into error.
I respectfully request that we either call
the Hon Minister in, adjourn temporarily
and ask one of the Ministers - they are
three Hon Ministers, Mr Speaker. One of
them ought to be available to assist the
House in doing our work. What that
suggests in my opinion,is that this Bill
must be important. If it is not, then I want
to move that the House adjourns.
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, as much as I
appreciate what the Hon Member is saying,
that if a Minister was available, he would
assist the House in the deliberations -- yet
if it was such an important matter that in the
absence of a Minister ,we cannot do our
work, we cannot do a Bill, it would have
been contained in the Standing Orders, that
in the absence of a Minister, we cannot
proceed to discuss a Bill. It is not there; it
is a practice, a convention. It is useful if
the Hon Minister is there.
But this is a House that is competent
enough to make laws without the
Ministers necessarily being present. If
the Hon Minister is available to assist us,
we would be happy about that, but to say
that we have to adjourn proceeding
because a Minister is not available, is not
correct.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Majority Leader, do you want us to
reduce this to some order or the order
before this Honourable House says that
when a Minister brings a business which
in effect he is prosecuting before this
Honourable House, he or she can stay
away and the Honourable House cannot
say that they want the Minister and that
in the absence of the Minister, they are
not inclined to proceed until the Minister
comes?
Hon Majority Leader, I would very
much like you to please rethink this and
maybe confer with your Colleagues,
otherwise you would be putting the
House into difficulty.
It must be well clear to us that this
House would want to exert its
independence and also its autonomy and
dignity separate from the Executive. I
think this is something that the two of you
may seriously think about. But it is
something which if you press to its logical
conclusion, will not be in the interest of
the business that you seek to prosecute
this morning.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I rise to agree
with you on what’ you have said. I think
when Hon Ministers are here, they do
enhance our work, but for this particular
instance, I would want to plead that I have
called the Hon Deputy Minister and he is
on his way to Parliament right now. The
clause 33 is not technical. The clause 33
we are dealing with, with or without the
Hon Minister, will really not harm us. So if
I could plead with you so that we would
take the clause 33 and wait for his arrival.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I am very
anxious to proceed. It is a matter for the
House. . .
Mr Dery: Mr Speaker, I think from what
my Hon Brother had said, we are not really
in a crisis. I think we should suspend for
the Hon Deputy Minister to come. Let us
suspend for him to come and we continue.
Mr Speaker, I want to thank iny Hon
Brother for his intervention and to say that
the Hon Leader should not always be
going for rules. This is because there are
other rules that can be used to make sure
that things do not happen here. So,
please, let us stand it down, suspend
Sitting and let the Hon Deputy Minister
come and lead. -
Mrs Akosua Frema 0sei-Opare: Mr
Speaker, I do appreciate statements like
"if the Ministers are herethey will enhance
our work." Truly, when the Executive
brings a Bill, it becomes the property of
Parliament. As a matter of fact, Mr Speaker,
I have myself lamented several times when
we have Ministers, more or less, even
interfering with the work of Parliament. I
do not want to revisit a situation but we
have had a very unfortunate situation with
the University of Ghana Bill, for which
certain things happened which were not
Parliament’s decision._
I think Parliament, even though this has
been a precedent, needs to rethink
whether we want to own the process of
enacting a law or we want to cede that to
more or less the Ministers-- leading. I
believe very much that when it becomes
our property, we have competence and we
should have competence by the laws of
this country to enact the law. -If we so
desire to consult, we will, but we should
not make it that if they are not here, our
work is impeded. I do not think we should
even encourage that to happen. Even if it
had been a precedent, it is not time to revisit
that precedence. It is not in our interests.
11.30am. _
DrA. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, the point
being made is not that we do not have the
authority. It is the Executive that brings
the Bill. In terms of the policy implications,
they know the intent of the particular
issue. It appears that if you want
somebody to do something and you have
brought it to their attention -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: And that
is the purpose of the Memorandum.
Dr A. A. Osei: Yes, especially. Mr
Speaker, if our Colleagues want to insist
on Parliament taking control, we are in
control, there is competence. But I want
to invoke Standing Order 48 (1) and with
your permission I quote: "
"The presence of at least one-third
of all the Members of Parliament
besides the person presiding shall
be necessary to constitute a quorum
of the House."
Papa Owusu-Ankomah: Mr Speaker,
I am rising on a point of order. The fact is
that, there is a matter before the House
that has not been concluded, then my Hon
Colleague without even seeking leave of
the Speaker, or giving an indication that
he is abandoning or pursuing his point,
rises andhe raises another issue. But 1
do not think Mr Speaker has ruled on the
matter that he raised.
Before you rule, Mr Speaker, I know
that yes, we can do it, certainly. It is a
matter for Parliament to discuss a Bill. The
Committee has done its work, it has
submitted its Report, amendments have
been filed, we can continue. Except that it
is always prudent to facilitate the process
to get the Minister here so that in case
certain amendments are raised, he would
have the opportunity to respond to
whatever issues that are raised here to
enable the House arrive at an informed
decision.
Of course, it does not mean that in the
absence of the Minister, we cannot go on.
However, if that position is taken, then
of course, the House or individual
Members may then insist on a strict
adherence to the Standing Orders of the
House which may not necessarily promote
or facilitate Public Business. It is in the
light of this, that I would urge the Hon
Leader of the House to rather make a
conciliatory statement so that we can
together embark on this course.
I am also urging my Hon Colleague
who prematurely raised that issue to hold
his horses for some minutes while Mr
Speaker encourages us to movethe
business of the House forward.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I thank
you very much.
I think on that note - Yes, Hon
Majority Leader, once you are on your
feet.-
Mr Avoka: I thank Mr Speaker and
everybody for the concerns raised. But I
want to assure the House as the Chairman
of the Committee indicated, while we go
on, the Minister or his Deputy is on the
way; he will arrive to assist us to
deliberate on this Bill.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Very well.
Then clause 33 - Chairman of the
Committee, there is an amendment which
stands in your name.
MrAsaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move
clause 33, paragraph (d), after "money"
delete "generated" and insert "which is
generated by the Commission".
Mr Speaker, the reason is that, we want
to distinguish between money generated
by the Commission on its own and money
generated as a result of renewable energy
sources.
Question put and amendment agreed
to.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move
clause 33, paragraph (e), line 1, delete
"lodged in" and insert "approved by the
Board from" and in line 3, after "develop-
ment" insert "management". .
Mr Speaker, it is not the entire Energy
Fund that would be used to finance
activities from renewable energy sources.
It is only sums approved by the Board for
that purpose. So that is the rationale for
the amendment.
Mr Opare-Ansah: Mr Speaker, l would
like the Chairman of the Committee to
consider a further amendment of his
amendment by putting a commabefore the
"management", otherwise, it would
become "development management."
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I did not
get you.
Mr Opare-Ansah: Mr Speaker, I was
urging the Hon Chairman to consider
inserting a comma before "management"
so that it would read "development,
management and utilisation," and not
"development management." '
Mr Asaga:  you very much.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: That is
well taken. '
Question put and amendment agreed
to.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move,
clause 33, paragraph (f), line 1, delete
"approved" and insert "provided"-
This is because the Minister for
finance and Economic Planning provides
money but the approval is given by
Parliament. ' '
Question put and amendment dgreed
to.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move,
clause 33, add the following new
subclause: "
"the proportion of Government levy
from the export of bio-fuel
determined by Cabinet and
approved by Parliament".
This amendment is to provide an
additional source of funds for the
development of renewable energy. ’
Mrs Osei-Opare: Mr Speaker, I want
to further amend the amendment, that we
delete "determined by Cabinet", and just
put after "bio-fuel", "as approved by
Parliament".
- Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I think the
further amendment is accepted. This is
because at the end of the day, it would be
brought to Parliament. So whatever
happens Parliament still has the authority.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: In any
case, the levy itself is already described
as government levy. Very well -- so it
would be;
"The proportion of Government
levy from the export of bio-fuel
approved by Parliament."
Question put and amendment agreed
to.
Clause 33 as amended ordered to stand
part of the Bill.
Clause 34 ordered to stand part of the
Bill. .
Clause 35 - Management of the Fund
11.40 am.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move,
clause_35, subclause (3.), paragraph (c),
line 2, before "Fund" insert "utilisation".
The reason is that, the procedure
referred to is for utilisation of the Fund. It
is more appropriate to qualify the Fund
here with "utilisation" to remove. any
ambiguity.
Mrs Osei-Opare; Mr Speaker, if I
understood the amendment right, then I
believe that we need a further amendment
that says "the utilisation of the Fund" not
"utilisation Fund."
Mr Asaga: It is there. I think it was
typcigraphical error from the Clerks-at-the
-table.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Well, for
the avoidance of doubt, we will correct it
to "utilisation of the Fund".
Question put and amendment agreed to.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move,
clause 35 subclause (3), paragraph (d),
delete and insert the following:
"prepare and publish the criteria for
the disbursement of moneys from
, the Fund with the approval of the
Minister".
Question put and amendment agreed
to.
Clause 35 as amended ordered to stand
part of the Bill.
Clause 36 - Internally generated
funds. 
Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, I need to
seek some clarification from the Hon
Deputy Minister.
Does clause 36 mean that one hundred
per cent will be retained? Is that the
intent? I ask that because it says subject
to the Act, the Fund is authorised to retain
moneys realised in the performance of its
fiinctions. So, it is one hundred per cent.
What is the percentage? The Act does
not give a blanket percentage. I am not
against retaining hundred percent but the
way I am reading it, it implies hundred per
cent. Is that your intent? I have no
difficulty with it, I just want to be sure.
Alhaji Inusah A. B. Fuseini: Mr
Speaker, I understand that is actually the
intention of the provision -
Dr A. A. Osei:,Mr Speaker, I beg to
move, clause 36, subclause (1), line 2, after
"retain" insert "all".
Alhaj i Fuseini: Mr Speaker, I think that
an amendment is being proposed by the
former Hon Minister of State to insert after
"retain" the Word "all" and we support
the amendment.
Question put and amendment agreed
to
Clause 36 as amended ordered to stand
part of the Bill. A
Clauses 37 to 41 ordered to stand part
of the Bill.
Clause 42 - Designation and prices
of bio-fuel.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I wish to
correct the spelling of "bio-fuel" on the
Order Paper before I move the amendment.
It is supposed to be "bio-fuel" not "bio-
fuels".
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: It is
supposed to be singular which is actually
in the Bill itself. Is that not so?
Mr Asaga: Yes, Mr Speaker.
Mr Speaker, I beg to move, clause 42,
subclause (1), line 2, after "bio-fuel" insert
"blend".
_That is because it has now become a
product which is supposed to be used for
producing energy. So "blend" must come
there because other additives are added
to it;
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So, it will
be "bio-fuel blend" - '
11.5O am.
Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, if that is
the case then the heading:'"Designation
and pricing of bio-fuel." should be:
"Designation and pricing of bio-fuel
blend". The same amendment should
apply to the heading, just to be sure.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
heading should be "bio-fuel blend", and
in the body we put it: "bio-fuel blend".
The amendments are clear.
Question put and amendment agreed
to. 
[MR SECOND DEPUTY SPEAKER]
subclause (1) is deleted and I would put
the Question to the rest of 1t. So clause
43, any observations? 
Dr Kojo Appiah-Kubi: Mr Speaker, I
believe that the 43 (3) should read:
"A person who sells bio-fuel at the
point of sale shall display
consicuously the proportion of
bio-fuel blend contained in the bio-
fuel."
Those two words, excuse me, because
the person is selling bio-fuel; as you are
saying -- So they should be changed;
the bio-fuel blend should be added to the
last bio-fuel, because the person is selling
bio-fuel and not -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Member, proceed with your argument.
You have finiished, or conceded?
Dr. Appiah-Kubi: I am being confused
by my Hon Colleagues. [Laughter]
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Member, you are alone; have the floor.
You cannot be confused by anyone else.
So if you want to concede, you may as
well do so. -
Dr Appiah-Kubi: Thank you, Mr
Speaker. I withdraw my amendment.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: You are
satisfied?
I thank you very much.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
clause 43, I think we can get the flow from
the sub-caption of 43 . But then ‘the
caption for clauses 41, 42, 43 and 44 read:
"Control and management of bio-
fuel and wood fuel."
So the section is not only about bio-
fuel blends. I think we should be a bit
careful. Clause 43 is on the sale of bio-
filel blend, but I am saying that the caption
for clauses 41 up to 44 is on "control and
management of bio-fuel and wood fuel".
Are we saying that the caption should
read: .
"Control and management of bio-
fuel blend and wood fuel"?
So let us make the distinction clear
and then I think we can move on.
12.00 noon. _
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, that is
very right and appropriate observation.
But clauses 42 and 43 deal with bio-fuel
blends and clause 44 deals with wood fuel
production. That whole section comes
under the "control and management of
bio-fuels and wood fuel".
So if he is seeking to amend the head-
note, it should be "Control and
management of bio-fuel blend and wood
fuel". This is because, Mr Speaker, wood
fuel cannot be blended. Wood fuel, we
are dealing with the sustainability of its
use and that is captured under clause 44.
But the use of "wood fuel" and "bio-fuel"
comes under the headnote.-
"Control and management of bio-
fuel blend and wood fuel".
I therefore propose, if that is
acceptable -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
headnote reads "Control and management
of wood fuel blend" -
Alhaji Fuseini: "Bio-fuel blend" __
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: "Bio-
fuel blend and wood fuel".
Hon Minority Leader --
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: MrSpeaker,
the difficulty then persists; this is because
if you look at clause 41, we are talking
about the production of bio-fuel from
feedstock. That is why I am saying that
let us be very careful about where we are
because that one is on the production of
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Chairman of the Committee, that affects
both items (ix) and (x)?
Mr Asaga: That is consequential.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So
consequentially we come to (x) -- Clause
42. -
Question put and amendment agreed
to.
Clause 42 as amended ordered to stand
part of the Bill.
Clause 43 - Sale of bio-fuel blend.
MrAsaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move,
clause 43, subclause (1), delete.
This is because it is in the Interpretation
section therefore does not need. to appear
there.
Question put and amendment agreed
to. -
Mr Opare-Ansah: Mr Speaker, the bio-
fuel blend is not in the Interpretation
section. But Bio-fuel is there. Is the
Chairman now intending to move an
amendment to put it there? _
Mr Asaga: Yes, we are moving it to
Interpretation. -
Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, just for my
own education. Subclause (3), a person
who sells bio-fuel; should it be bio-fuel or
bio-fuel blend? [Interruption.] Blend?
then he needs to offer an amendment.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, we had already
indicated that most of them are
consequential; where we have bio-fuel, it
is bio-fuel blend.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I think
you better come out clearly.
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, I think that
was an oversight. Even in the provision
we said so. A person who offers to sell
bio-fuel at the point of sale shall display
conspicuously the proportion of the bio-
fuel contained in the bio-fuel blend. I think
it was left out.
Mr Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr
Speaker, clause 43(1) provides for the
purposes of this section; bio-fuel blend
is the combination of a proportion of bio-
fuel and petroleum-based fuel. Now, the
Chairman of the Committee is saying that
we should delete 43 (1) and relocate it to
the Interpretation column. What is he
going to offer to this House? We should
first of all establish that bio-fuel blend
does not have any other meaning
anywhere in the Bill.
This is because the definition provided
here is sections-specific. That is why it is
said that "for purposes of this section".
So he should be sure it has no other
meaning anywhere else in the Bill before
you relocate it to the Interpretation section
and give it that name, otherwise we would
be wrong.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, it has no other
meaning except the meaning that we have
indicated here. '
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: It does
not appear elsewhere?
Mr Asaga: No,Mr Speaker.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Minority Leader, that is your assurance.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
I want to believe what he is saying. For
the time being, I cannot doubt him.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: If it
appears somewhere else, we shall advise
ourselves. For the avoidance of doubt,
[MRKYEI-MENSAH-BONSU]
bio-fuel from feedstock -- clause 41. Now,
clause 42 is talking about bio~fuel blend;
so let us be very careful.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I think that
clauses 41 and 42 are discussing the actual
production of the bio-fuel. But when it
comes to sale, you must do something to
that product for it to be saleable and that
is the difference.
So if, for example, you use sugar to
produce alcohol, you cannot immediately
use that alcohol you have produced to
fuel an engine; but you now have to add
an additive to it and that is why it now
becomes blended. At that point, you are
now selling it; that is the sale point now.
And that is where the product now
becomes bio-fuel blend but the
production itself, you are producing a bio~
fuel. . -
Mr Joseph Kofi Adda: Mr Speaker,
indeed, I do appreciate what the Hon
Chairman has said, but I think the Hon
Minority Leader’s point still holds andlthink
it may be easier- [Interruption]
Mr Asaga: He is always talking of
Minority Leader -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Hon Ada, you continue. 
Mr Adda: Mr Speaker, the Hon
Chairman seems to have a problem with
any new ideas that come up in this
Chamber that necessitates our re-thinking
of issues. So if anything has been
discussed in the Committee and we come
here and get new ideas, and Hon
Colleagues are contributing to improve the
Bill, I do not see why we should not
comment on that. I do not see why We
should not support those points if they
are new, I do not know.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Adda, proceed. _
Mr Adda: It has been a habit of his
and I want him to stop that. .
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Adda, you are the only one who has the
floor.
Mr Adda: Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Mr Speaker, I think the Hon Minority
Leader’s point is still relevant and I think
he can make it easier for all of us if in the
headnote, we go back and consider the
production aspect and generalise the bio-
fuel aspect by adding "s" to "bio-fuel",
making it "bio-fuels", leaving out the
"blend" that we had agreed should be
included in the headnote earlier. That way,
the "bio-fuels" can cover clause 41 and
still go on to deal withthe fiiel aspect of it
because it is a general point about bio-
fuels.
The only element that needs to be
reflected in the headnote, if we so wish,
Mr Speaker, is the production aspect of it
which means that it would be
comprehensive. Mr Speaker, we might
want to consider "Control, production and
management of bio-fuels and woodfuel"
and that covers everything -
production, management which could
include sales and management of it. So
that when we go into clauses 41, 42, 43,
we cover everything about the production
and sales and that there is no difficulty
limiting ourselves to bio-fuel blend as
reflected in clauses 42 and 43 and then
having to deal with the clause 41
separately.
So Mr Speaker, my proposal is that if
we were to amend the headnote to include
production and then an "s" after the "bio-
fuel", it would read "control production
and management of bio-fuels and Wood
fuel". I think that would deal with clauses
41, 42, 43 to cover what the Hon Minority
Leader has said and also to take care of
what the Hon Chairman and Hon Deputy
Minister are concerned about. -
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: If I get
the Hon Member right, Hon Members, the
idea is to make it generic; bring in an
omnibus expression under which all others
can fall then we proceed without any
difficulty. So that if I get the Hon Member
correct once more, it should be "control
production and management of bio-fuels
and wood fuel". Then "bio-fuels". will
continue to flow under that general
omnibus expression.
Hon Adda, is that your direction, if you
may?
Mr, Adda: That is very true, Mr
Speaker; that is indeed my intervention.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I thank
you very much. '
Hon Minister, you think that would
help us?
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, l get the
sense in which the Hon Member has
proposed the amendment and I take
opportunity to withdraw the earlier
amendment that was proposed to include
"blend" in the headnote. .
But Mr Speaker, that amendment
would not apply in a situation -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: In which
particular place?
Alhaji Fuseini: In this clause 42,
especially under the sub-title "Control and
management". Mr Speaker, this sub~title
in intended to control and manage bio-
fuel as a raw material, produced from a
feedstock. So you mustliave a feedstock
from which to produce bio-fuel and then
you have wood from which to produce
wood fuel. The headnotes here are dealing
with those two situations or these two
situations. -
That when you are dealing with bio-
fuel from a feedstock, you ought to obtain
a licence. The licence would seek to
control and manage the production.
‘When you want to establish a woodlot,
from which to produce wood fuel, you
need to consult the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Energy
Commission to be able to do so. Again,
that consultation would seek to control
and manage the use of wood fuel. Wood
fuel cannot be blended; bio-fuel can be
blended.
So when you say "control and
management of bio-fuel" and you are
talking of "bio-fuel blend", are you
suggesting that wood fuel can be
blended? So Mr Speaker -
[Interruption] --- No, because he is
saying that we should amend the
headnote to read "Control, production
and management of bio-fuels". 
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: And
wood fuel;,Hon Minister, "and wood fuel".
I hope, Hon Adda, I got you right?
12.10 p.m. .
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, I thought
that it was standing at "bio-fuels". Mr.
Speaker, I think that this will require the
intervention of the technical men, so I will
crave your indulgence and your leave and
see whether that -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: We will
stand that down while we make progress.
But with that, let-them consider that
omnibus expression that will capture the
rest that will flow therefrom.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, while we are
making the consultation and trying to
agree with the Ranking Member, I think
he should not stretch it -
Mr _Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Member, let all that be part of the
consultation. Let us make progress.
Clause 44 --- Sustainability of wood
fuel production.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move,
clause 44, delete and insert the following:
"The Commission shall collaborate
With:
(a) Forestry Commission;
(b) Environmental Protection
Agency;
(c) Metropolitan, Municipal and
District Assemblies of the
concerned Local Government;
and
(d) Any other relevant institution to
ensure the development and
implementation ofprogrannnesto
sustain woodfuel production and
consumption."
We are making this amendment
because we believe that there are other
stakeholders that we needed to include,
especially the Metropolitan/Municipal
and District Assemblies.
Mrs Osei-Opare: Mr Speaker, I would
like to make a further amendment and the
amendment is to include specifically
"Ministry ofAgriculture". I do so because
the Ministry of Agriculture; even in its
management of soil fertility and crop
production and all that, do engage in some
intercropping programmes that produce
wood fuel as well as serve as arenewable
soil fertility measure, like the use of
Luciana, for instance, which can grow
quickly as wood fuel but at the same time
bring in more nitrogen into the soil.
So I believe that the Ministry of
Agriculture cannot be treated as any‘
other but it should be a substantive
institution to collaborate with under the
wood fuel production.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, all that the Hon
Colleague has said is right but a lot of it is
really under the Forestry Commission.
And if there is any other thing that the
Forestry Commission cannot perform, that
is why we have "and any other relevant
institutions" to cater for -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The Hon
Member is of the view that the Ministry
ofAgriculture is so obviously relevant that
it should be listed-- and then you have
"any other". Does it spoil anything to
have a (d) and a (e), "any other"? In fact,
bio-fuel is essentially an agricultural
activity, so what is the problem? When
We come to bio~fuel and renewable energy
generally, we are -
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I think there is
merit in it, in the sense that even when
one wants to do a wind farm one needs to
look at the crops, et cetera that is there.
[Interruption] I said a wind farm -
"wind". If the Hon Member does not
understand English, he should open his
ears. I said wind farm. So wind farms are
the farms that are - '
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Asaga, if a person does not understand
English, it does not matter how much he
opens his ears, the noise will still be there
but he will not understand. [Laughter]
Mr Opare-Ansah: Mr Speaker, in any
case, I will understand the English that he
speaks to me. If he continues to say "wee
farm", "wee farm", does he want me to
hear it as "wind"? He said "wee farm"-
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Order!
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, did I hear him
say "wee farm"? Did he say "wee farm"?
He is saying "wee farm". I said "wind
farm". I mean mframa farm. [Laughter]
So the mframa farms are very important
when it comes to bio-fuel. So I think that
we will add the Ministry of Agriculture to
it. 
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So (d)
will be "Ministry of Agriculture", and (e)
will be "any other relevant institution".
"Hon Adda, do you want to add
another?
Mr Adda: Mr Speaker, indeed, l wanted
to comment on what was just discussed
between the Chairperson and the --
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Adda, unfortunately we have gone
beyond that. So we are moving forward.
So (d) "Ministry of Agr"iculture"' and
(e) "Any other relevant institution".
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, l think
because we have now indicated the
"Ministry of Agriculture", we need to
consider carefully the -provision dealing
with the Forestry Commission because
they answer to the Minister -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: It does
not matter.
Alhaji F useini: Very well.
Dr Appiah-Kubi: Mr Speaker, clause
46 seems to suggest it is the Ministry
which is going to develop the programme
itself, therefore I would like to propose,
delete, consult, and insert "collaborate
with" -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
Commission shall ensure the development
but that it will collaborate with certain
agencies in the process.
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, there is a
very serious concern here. The original
intendment of the provision was to
encourage decentralization because in the
production-- In fact, that provision was
seriously debated when your Committee
met to consider the Bill. 
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Come
again? 
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, this
provision was seriously discussed and
the amendment came out of the collective
wisdom of the members on your
Committee to decentralize process.
Indeed, at the District Assembly level the
Ministry of Agriculture is represented
there. And if we look at the agencies or
institutions here, they are actually
specialized institutions, or specialized
agencies.
So indeed, when the Metropolitan/
Municipal and District Assemblies came
out for consideration, many of your
members had suggested that it should be
the Ministry of Local Government and
Rural Development but other Members
thought that, let us empower and further
strengthen the decentralization concept.
Mr Speaker, ---I seriously appreciate
what the Hon Frema Osei-Opare has
proposed. But what we are doing here, if
it passes, we will unconsciously be
recentralizing the whole process and I
think that one day, future generations will
look at this Bill and say that we, by our
act, has reversed the "process of
decentralization.
So Mr Speaker, I think that let us leave.
it this way so that the consultation will be
at the district level. Indeed, if a good farm
is to be done in, for instance, your district,
Dome Kwabenya, it is the District
Assembly that will take the decision as to
where and when to do the woodlot and
not the Ministry of Agriculture.
Thank you very much
12:20 p.m. 
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Thank
you very much.
So the idea is, if we were not to do that
then under clause 44 (c), for example, we
would be bringing in the Hon Minister for
Local Government and Rural Development
and that is not the spirit of the -
Very well.
Mrs Osei-Opare: Mr Speaker, I am
not substituting the clause 44 (c) for --
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Osei-Opare, it is not being said that there
is any substitution. The idea is, if you
bring in the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture, in effect, it is the Minister for
Agriculture and then it will lose that spirit
of going to the grass roots, decentralizing;
that spirit which brought about clause 44
(c) for example. Otherwise, it is going to
be a governmental agency. So, we should
work with the local - that is the essence
of it.
Mrs Opare-Osei: Mr Speaker, I do
appreciate the argument but l also want
to stress the importance of the Ministry
responsible for agriculture in view of the
role that they play in terms of food
security, demarcation of land for various
purposes, and the use of arable land for
other purposes. So, in this case, as well
as the decentralized structure, which I fully
appreciate, it is important to recognize the
role of the Ministry of Agriculture in this
particular situation.
This is because it is not simply any
other agency, they have a mandatory role
in terms of land use particularly for food
security purposes in our country. So, I
do still believe that it will be enriching the
clause by actually adding the "Ministry
of Agriculture". I want to further amend it
by saying, "Ministry responsible for
Agriculture", in case they change the
name some day.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Member, the decentralization spirit is very
important and at the Metropolitan,
Municipal and District Assemblies level,
we have the agriculture officers who
answer to the Ministryof Food and
Agriculture. So, when the Assembly
comes in, in effect, they have come in and
that is the essence of the spirit he is
speaking about.-
Mr Kwabena Okyere Darko-Mensah:
Mr Speaker, that is exactly what I had
wanted to add, that at the district level,
we have the agriculture sector firmly under
the Assemblies so, we need to put it
squarely under the foot of the Assemblies
just to enhance decentralization. It is very
important.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: All right.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
if the Chair could sanitize "clause 44 (c) --
Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies of the concerned Local
Government". I think it is not good
enough. We could say "a concerned
Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies", or "the relevant
Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies".
I think that would be better. .
Mr Second Deputy Speaker:
Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies - Hon Minister, you would
want to look at this in terms of
Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies as may be necessary.
Mr Asaga: Yes, I think-
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Minority Leader, so if we spoke about
Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies as may be necessary, does
that -
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
I think we are talking about the target
Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies. So, we can only say "the
concerned", or if you like, "the relevant
Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies". Or if we like, it should not
even be "and" but "or" "the relevant
Metropolitan, Municipal or District
Assemblies". 
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: "The
relevant Metropolitan, Municipal or
Dist'1ictAsse,mblies."
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I agree with
the Hon Minority Leader. I beg to move,
clause 44 (c) to read as follows:
"The relevant Metropolitan,
Municipal and DistrictAssemblies".
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: No. It is
".. . or District Assemblies".
Mr Asaga: No, the "or" should not
come in because the two are of different
legalities. Municipal Assemblies have a
certain status; and District Assemblies
have a certain status so it shouldbe "and";
why "or"?
Mr Opare-Ansah: Mr Speaker, if you
look at the last part of it, it says "the
concerned Local Government". There can
be only one authority at any Local
Government level so it is ‘-"or", not "and"-
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: The
authority is either Metropolitan,
Municipal or District.
Mr Opare-Ansah: Mr Speaker, the
authority is either Metropolitan,
Municipal or District because he said "the
concerned Local Government".
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: It cannot
be one and the other.
Mr Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah: Mr
Speaker, it should be "or".
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Very
well; "the relevant Metropolitan,
Municipal or District Assemblies".
Chairman of the Committee, are you
satisfied?
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I am satisfied
since there are "grammar teachers" here,
we accept the "or".
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Thank
you very much.
Question put and amendment agreed
to.
Clause 44 as amended ordered to stand
as part of the Bill. '
Clause 45 ordered to stand part of the
Bill. 
Clause 46 -- Integration of renewable
energy projects into power system.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move,
clause 46, Headnote, delete "power" and
insert "energy".
This is more of a, broader scope than
just power which is narrower.
Question put and amendment agreed
to.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I beg to move,
clause 46, delete and insert the following:
"(1) The Public Utilities Regulatory
Commission and the Energy
Commission shall, in developing
Regulations and guidelines for the
provision of electricity, take into
account the particular nature of the
electricity generated from renewable
energy projects are integrated into
the power system.
(2)The National Petroleum Authority
shall in developing guidelines for
the provision of petroleum
products take into account the
particular nature of the fuels
produced from renewable energy‘
sources to ensure that relevant
renewable energy projects are
integrated into the fuel supply
system."
In the first part, there is a re-
arrangement of the checks, whereas for
the second one, this is to ensure that the
National Petroleum Authority (NPA)
incorporates fuel produced from
renewable energy sources into its
guidelines. This is because for now the
NPA only deals with fossil fuels, that is
more of petroleum. But now that we are
introducing bio-fuels We think that NPA
should now have the authority to manage
those new products.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Thank
you very much.
12.30 p.m. 
Mr Opare -Ansah: Mr Speaker, the first
portion of the proposed amendment, if you
read it carefully, you will -see that there
seems to be a word missing in the last
line. With your permission: I will read,
"The Public Utilities Regulatory
Commission and the Energy
Commission shall, in developing
Regulations and guidelines for the
provision of electricity, take into
account the particular nature of the
electricity generated fiom renewable
energy projects are integrated into
the power system." 
I think it should be that are "integrated
into the power system".
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: " Projects
that are --"
Mr Opare-Ansah: "Integrated"-
Otherwise, it does not make sense. What
you are seeking to say is that, in
developing the guidelines they shall take
into consideration the characteristics of
the project that they are integrating.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: I am sure
you got that, Hon Chairman of the
Committee?
It should take account of those types
of "so and so’ which are generated into
the system.
Mr Asaga: I think we will insert the
"that".
Mr Second Deputy Speakcn Very well.
So it will read ". . .generated from
renewable energy projects .that are
integrated into the power system".
MrAsaga: Mr Speaker, we need to also
do it consequentially for the second
one.That is (2); it is also there as "are
integrated". So we have to put "that are
integrated".
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: No.
Mr Asaga: It is the same rendition.
~ Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Actually,
it does not follow at all. 
MrAsaga: So we will leave it as it is.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Hon
Minority Chief Whip, do you have a
further amendment?
Mr Opare-Ansah: Mr Speaker, we are
advised that by introducing the "that", it
will change the sense of it. But we are also
not too sure about the particular nature
of that phrase which is what currently
seems to be the one to be integrated. So
we advise that, if you can stand it down
briefly while we consult and look at it. By
the introduction of "that", the idea is they
want to ensure this is integrated, that is
why they are saying "are integrated".
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: "Take
into account the particular nature of the
electricity generated from renewable
energy projects that are integrated into
the power system." If you say, for example
that you should ensure that something
should be done, then we will not need
that. But if you leave it as it is, then there
will be a "that", otherwise there will be no
meaning. But if it is to ensure something
should be done then there will be no need
to say "that are integrated"; and it
depends upon the true intention -
Mr Buah: Mr Speaker, I think that I
am trying to change the wording so that
we can have a real sense of what the
language is. What I am adding here is to
say,
"take into account the particular
nature of electricity generated from
renewable energy projects to
ensure that they are integrated into
the power system".
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker I think
we ought to stand it down. What is the
intendment? Are we looking to the future
or to the present? The provision does not
clearly come out. I have just consulted,
we appear to be looking to the future. So
let us stand it down, Mr Speaker, and see
which wording will capture the real
intendment, that is 46 (1). '
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: In other
words, it is to generate something to be
done. 
Very well.
So we will not put the Question on
clause 46 as a whole. We will move on to
clause 47. 
MrAsaga: I think for clause 46 (2), %
Does it have the same problem?
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: It does
not matter but we will put the Question
on clause 46- We cannot separate (a) and
(b). I hope you are with me, Hon Chairman
of the Committee‘?
Chairman of the Committee,
"The Public Utilities Reglplatory
Commission and the nergy
Commission shall, in developing
Regulations and guidelmes for the
provision of electricity, take into
account the particular nature of the
electricity generated from renewable
energy projects and ensure that
they are integrated into the power
system".
Do you think that is how -~
_ Alhaji Fuseini: I think that there was
a fundamental problem. The Table Office
did not capture it the way it was
suggested to them. And Mr Speaker, with
your indulgence I read to you what was
presented to the Table Office. It is,
"The Energy Commission and the
Public tilities _ Regulatory
Commission shall, 111 developing
Regulations and guidelines for the
provision of electricity, take into
account the particular nature of
the electricity generated from
renewable energy sources to
ensure that relevant renewable
projects are integrated."
So the whole phrase was mixed up.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Very well.
I think now it is very clear.
Alhaji Fuseini: The second one will
also rea as follows:
"The NationalPetroleum Authority
in developing guidelines for the
provision of petroleum products
take into account the particular
nature of the fuel produced from
renewable energy sotuces to ensure
that relevant renewable energy
projects are integrated". 
With the second one, there is no
problem; the first one 1s the problem.
12.40p.m.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: We will
capture it from that and so l Wlll put the
Question. I think they are very clear.
Question put and amendment agreed
to.
Clause 46 as amended ordered to stand
part of the Bill.
Clause 47 - Offences and penalties.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker,Ibeg to move,
clause 47, Headnote, delete and insert
"Other offences" _
Mr Speaker, in the original rendition, it
is "Offences and penalties" but now we
want to replace "Offences and penalties"
with "Other Offences". This is because if
you go to clauses 26 and 27, we had
mentioned certain offences and penalties
there.
Mr Opare-Ansah: Mr Speaker,
yesterday when the Hon Chairman moved
the Motion for that particular amendment
to introduce "penalties", I had wanted to
suggest that we rather look through the
Bill and move all offences and penalties
to this particular section. I think it will be
neater than having it scattered throughout
in the Bill ,so we do not have to change
the heading. If we have any other
offences and penalties hiding anywhere
in the Bill, let us rather move it under this
section. 
MrKyei-Mensah-Bonsu: MrSpeaker,
I think it would be neater that way. But if it
cannot be done, then we wouldrather
retain the words "and penalties". The
Chairman may add "Other offences and
penalties", because that provision also
covers penalties. So he cannot say that
we should delete "and penalties". If we
have to retain it, it has to be "Other
offences and penalties".
But the neater way would be to fish for
offences and penalties captured
elsewhere and relocate them here. But
while we are at it, if it cannot be done and
this one has to be retained, it would have
to be "Other offences and penalties".
MrHackman Owusu-Agyemang: Mr
Speaker, in support of the two Hon
Leaders, if we say "Other offences" then
if there are offences other than What is
speculated here then I would understand.
But Mr Speaker, it says‘.
"A person who commits an offence
under this Act is liable on summary
conviction to . . ."
So if we put "Other offences" then the
formulation of this partiucular one seems
to suggest like an omnibus provision for
those who commit offences and the
penalty that are due accordingly. So I do
not know why it should be "Other
offences". And if they are other offences
then they cannot be broader than the
person who commits an offence under this
Act [Who] is liable on summary
conviction. . ."
It gives one the impression, Mr
Speaker, if you like, that it is maybe the
major thrust of offences that would be
committed under this Act. So it cannot be
titled "Other offences’?
Mr Speaker, I do not know whether my
point is very clear?
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Yes,
Hon Member.
Mr Owusu-Agyemang: Mr Speaker, it
gives the impression that there are other
offences. But if this is not the major one
and there are other supplementary ones
or other offences, then it has to be so
captured. But the rendition here does not
leave any doubt. It looks as if that is
the main one regarding offences.
Mr Avoka: Mr Speaker, "it appears, that
the provision "Other offences and
penalties" or the suggestion made by the
Hon Minority Leader does not hold
because clause 47 does not create any
offence, it talks about only a penalty or
sanctions. For example, if we say "a
person who commits an offence under this
Act is liable on summary conviction to a
fine" or this or that, there is no offence
created under the section so if we put
"Other offences and penalties" it would
look like the law is creating an offence or
specifying an offence, and therefore, after
that, sanctions or penalties. It talks about
only penalties so the issue of other
offences should not arise at all. It should
be "penalties".
The headnote should change and it
should not include "offences" because
there is no offence created under the
section.
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, that is
rightly so, but I also think that even that
section ought to be looked at once again.
This is because in the whole Bill, offences
have been created and penalties for them
provided. For instance, in the amended
version of clause 8, there is an offence of
engaging in a commercial activity Without
a licence and the penalty for doing that is
a fine not exceeding two thousand penalty
units or a term of imprisonment not
exceeding five years.
In clause 26, there is an offence
created for an electricity distribution
company which fails to buy a portion of
his power from renewable energy sources
and that it creates an offence and pays a
penalty - Over here, it is not two
thousand penalty units but one thousand
penalty unit. So specific offences have
been created and specific penalties
created.
In reading clause 47, it creates an
impression that this section applies to all
offences created under the Act, but I think
that the intendment isoffences created
under the Act not provided for, for which
no penalty has been provided. This is
because the penalty here is two hundred
and fifty penalty units and this is far less
than the penalty provided for in breach of
clause 8. It is also lesser than the penalty
provided for in breach of clause 26 (6).
But I think that the Attorney-General’s
Office would clean up that place and give
us a rendition to cover other offences not
provided for.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Which
they often will go by unless otherwise
provided and followed those things are -
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I think that we
had jumped the gun. If we were to go
further to the next amendment, there would
find all the offences there. Clause 47 states:
"A person who fails to - 
(a) display at the point of sale the
proportion of bio-fuel contained
in the bio-fuel blend contrary to
section 43; or
(b) maintain the equipment. . ." -
[Interruption]
There is another one on the Order
Paper creating the offences -
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: So
Chairman, you will abandon this one or
you want to proceed?
l2.5O p.m.
Alhaji Fuseinii Mr Speaker, in effect
what the Hon Chairman is saying is, if we
do the second amendment, item 9 (xvi),
that will give us an indication of the
offences contemplated in the headnotes.
So he is suggesting that we consider item
9 (xvi) on clause 47. [Interruption] Item
(xxviii) on page 9. [Interruption]
Mr Asaga: No, then it is a different
clause.
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, his is old.
I was actually holding the right Order
Paper, the Hon Member took it away from
me and said that I was holding the wrong
one.
Mr Speaker, if we do item 9 (xvi), the
offences contemplated for which the Hon
Minority Leader’s amendments would be
appropriate in the circumstances, are
contained there. I suggest that we take
them first and that would inform us as to
what amendment we should do to the
headnote.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
clearly, the offences relate to the section
from clause 41. Clause 41 says:
-"A licensee that has been granted
a licence under this Act to produce
bio-fuel from. . ."
I am not even talking about the amended
version, I am talking about the original:
"A licensee that has been granted a
licence under this Act to produce
bio-fuel from feedstock, shall obtain
the relevant permit from the Ministry
of Food and Agriculture and the
Environmental Protection Agency."
Assuming the person do es not do that,
certainly, an offence is committed. So it
begins from clauses 41, 42 and 43 and so
on. It relates to them and I think it is those
ones that have been encapsulated in the
amendment to clause 47 as captured under
item 9 (xxviii). So that is the import of it. It
refers definitely to those offences
captured in clauses 41, 42 and 43 and
following. I think that is understandable.
So yes, maybe we can mention them orwe
just say "other offences and penalties"
and then we refer to the subsequent
clauses.
Dr A. A. Osei: Mr Speaker, listening
to the Hon Minister and my other Hon
Colleagues, it appears, in my view, that
the best way is to look at where all
offences and penalties occur are in
clauses 8, 26 and this one, we put them
together so that we can go there and
know that under this Act these are the
offences and penalties.
But as it is, if I read clause 26 and I look
at the title and I see "Renewable energy
purchase obligation" and there is an
offence attached to it, then I go to clause
8, a different subject - Clause 8 is
"Requirement for licence" and at the end
of it there is an offence and the penalty, it
does not look neat. If we want offences
and penalties, let us move all of them to a
clause under this Bill on offences and
penalties for different offences and
different penalties. Then when we go
there it is all comprehensive.
Mr Asaga: Mr Speaker, I think that
that rearrangement would not be proper
in the sense that each of the "offences"
comes with certain functions and we do
not want someone to read through only
"offences" when he does not lcnow what
function he must perform to commit that
offence.
That is why for the various functions,
we immediately bring their offences so
that if I am not into generation of solar
but I am into sale of the bio-fuel blend, I
just go to bio~fuel blend, see what my
functions are, and if there are offences,
what I will be charged for, instead of going
to read something about generation when
I am not at the generation or distribution
level.
So I think that this sequence is much
more effective.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: Very
well, so clause 47, what do we have so
that we make progress? -
Yes, Hon Minister?
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, taking it
from where the Hon Minority Leader has
left off, we add "other offences" to the
headnote.
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: "Other
offences" to the headnote‘?
Alhaji Fuseini: And-
Mr Second Deputy Speaker: And
penalties. 
Alhaji Fuseini: We then consider the
second lap.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr Speaker,
since in my view, these offences and
penalties relate to clauses 41 and 43 we
could create the offence under clause 41,
that "A licensee who does not obtain the
relevant permit from the Ministry commits
an offence." That would be clause 41(b).
If you come to clause 43, we can create
subclause (4) and that would also be on
the same line. 
Then the penalties would be captured
in clause 47 because clearly they relate to
offences under clauses 41 and 43. Indeed,
shall I add clause 45.
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, I think that
the import of the amendment is that these
offences and penalties relate to clauses
41 and 45. That being so, we need to
provide for them. But in the proposed
amendment, there is already an indication
of the clauses and if I may read item 9 (Xvi)
on the Order Paper:
"A person who fails to.
(a) display at the point of sale the
proportion of bio-fuel contained
in the bio-filel blend contrary to
section 43"; or
(b) maintain the equipment and
property used in the provision
of the service contrary to
paragraph (a) of section 45;"
So there is an indication of the sections.
We can suggest an amendment to capture
clause 41, but it is provided for. So that
we know that these particular "Other
offences and penalties" relate to offences
committed in violation of clauses 41, 42,
43, 44 and 45.
Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsuz MrSpeaker,
we could then, for the avoidance of doubt,
state: "A person who commits an offence
under sections 41, 43 and 45 of this Act is
liable on summary conviction to . . ." so
that we refer to those sections. But if we
say "under this Act"- Otherwise, we
would have to capture clause 41 because
it is not captured here in the amendment,
so let us find a way to capture clause 41
there and it would still be relevant.
This is because there _is an act
imbedded in clause 41 which could
constitute an offence, so let us fnd a way
to capture that one in it as well, then I
think we would be home and dry.
Alhaji Fuseini: Mr Speaker, the
rendition - He did not create the offence
so I would say that we can shift it down
and say: "A person who fails to obtain
the relevant permit under section 41 from
the Ministry of F ood andAgriculture and
the Environmental Protection Agency. . ."
That would be subclause (b).
Mr Speaker, We can make an
amendment to capture clause 41 in this
sense
"A person who fails to:
(a) Obtain the relevant permit from
the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture or aperson who fails
to obtain the relevant permit
under section 41. . . [Power
outage]
1 .00 p.m. .
MrKyei-Mensah-Bonsu: It is on now,
Mr Speaker, if you may check your own.
Mr Cletus A. Avoka: Mr Speaker, I
earlier indicated that we are technically
challenged in terms of the address system
Besides, today is Friday and it is 1’o’clock
and we have other commitments to
undertake. So I beg to move, that we
adjourn proceedings from now until
Tuesday at 10’ o’clock,
Thank you.
Mr Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu: Mr
Speaker, inrecognition of the obvious and
the fact that even the Hon Deputy
Minister who is with us is determined and
indeed has purposed to go to the Mosque
to be followed by the Majority Leader and
I guess myself and Hajia Boforo, I beg to
second the Motion for adjournment.
Question put and Motion agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT
The House was accordingly
adjourned at 1.04 p.m. till Tuesday, 1st
November,2011 at 10.00 a.m.
